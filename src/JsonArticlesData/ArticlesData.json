The platform aims to help these modular blockchains and dApps attract more Total Value Locked (TVL) by leveraging community-owned liquidity rather than relying on mercenary capital.</p>\n\n<p>Mitosis is currently in development, with its vaults operational but the public testnet for the L1 is yet to launch. The platform has successfully raised $7 million in funding and has demonstrated remarkable growth, accumulating over <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/mitosis#information\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$80 million</a> in Total Value Locked (TVL) in just three months. The Mitosis team has formed close partnerships with notable dApps such as Ether.fi, Symbiotic, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/mitosisorg/mitosis-hyperlane-scalable-cross-chain-liquidity-5ac22543d66c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperlane</a>.</p>\n\n<p>EOL is still in development and promises several exciting benefits to all DeFi users. Most notably, EOL aims to simplify the decision-making process for retail liquidity providers. Retail users often experience choice overload when deciding where to allocate their liquidity. EOL addresses this challenge by unifying yields across different chains, allowing users to enjoy cross-chain yields while avoiding the hassle of comparing yields across multiple networks.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"About Mitosis 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11081/content_About_Mitosis_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 704px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Ecosystem Owned Liquidity (EOL)?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EOL is the flagship product of Mitosis; it is the pooling of liquidity across individual liquidity providers in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance structure. This allows retail liquidity providers to replicate the capabilities of large financial institutions in providing institutional-level liquidity within decentralized finance (DeFi). This approach enhances the bargaining power of individual liquidity providers, allowing them to benefit from the economies of scale associated with larger liquidity pools.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users will decide the allocation and terms of the liquidity provision through public governance votes and forum discussions.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What Is Ecosystem-Owned Liquidity 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11082/content_What_Is_Ecosystem-Owned_Liquidity_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 412px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ecosystem Owned Liquidity Pools (EOL LP) are accessed through Mitosis vaults. To use the Mitosis vault, a user deposits for instance, weETH into the weETH Mitosis vault and receives miweETH in return. This miweETH provides the user with voting rights, allowing them to influence how the pooled liquidity is managed within the vault.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What Is Ecosystem-Owned Liquidity 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11083/content_What_Is_Ecosystem-Owned_Liquidity_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 788px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mitosis vaults are created through extensive forum discussions at <a href=\"https://forum.mitosis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://forum.mitosis.org/</a>. In order to be an approved Mitosis vault, Protocols must first undergo forum discussion, followed by an initiation vote. If the proposal passes the vote, the vault is officially listed and added to the Mitosis platform. The earnings of the EOL accumulate in the Mitosis Vaults. Mitosis then distributes rewards to all Mitosis LPs, regardless of the network they chose for their deposits. This approach ensures that all LPs enjoy multi-chain yield exposure.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Vault Process\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11084/content_Mitosis_Vault_Process.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 938px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Airdrop Potential</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Funding\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11085/content_Mitosis_Funding.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 855px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To bootstrap liquidity, Mitosis introduces a campaign called “Mitosis Expeditions”, giving users points for liquidity deposited into their vaults. The team <a href=\"https://docs.mitosis.org/docs/expedition/expedition-weeth/participation-benefits\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">promised</a> that “Accumulating MITO Points (weETH) grants eligibility for Mitosis governance token ($MITO) airdrops.”</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mitosis offers an appealing opportunity for airdrop farming, thanks to its broad network of partnerships. This enables users to potentially access multiple airdrops through the Mitosis platform. For example, the newly introduced ezETH Mitosis vault now allows users to simultaneously farm airdrops from Renzo Protocol, EigenLayer, Linea, and Mitosis with a single deposit.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're interested in this approach, I've detailed a similar strategy around farming the Linea airdrop for your <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-earn-the-linea-airdrop-for-h2-2024\" target=\"_blank\">reference</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Earn Mitosis Points</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of this writing, Mitosis features four live vaults. To start accruing MITO Points, you can deposit into any of these vaults. Here is a step-by-step guide for depositing into the most popular EigenLayer Ether.fi vault.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Enter the Mitosis Expedition</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visit <a href=\"https://app.mitosis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.mitosis.org/</a> and connect your wallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11086/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 582px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accept and sign the prompted message.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11087/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 770px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Obtain weETH on Desired Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After joining the Mitosis expedition, you’ll be prompted to deposit weETH. You can choose from one of six networks to make your deposit: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Blast, Linea, Mode, and Scroll. If you choose to deposit on Scroll, which currently offers a 1.3x multiplier on MITO Points, follow these steps to obtain weETH on Scroll using Jumper.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11088/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 777px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visit <a href=\"https://jumper.exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://jumper.exchange/</a> and connect your wallet then choose your source chain and funds you wish to swap, and select weETH on Scroll as your destination token.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 4\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11089/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_4.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 628px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here I’m swapping USDC.e on Arbitrum to receive weETH on Scroll. Select your preferred bridge, sign the transactions and your weETH is on the way!</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 5\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11090/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_5.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 871px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Deposit your weETH</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next return to <a href=\"https://app.mitosis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.mitosis.org/</a> and deposit your Scroll weETH. Make sure that you’ve selected the correct vault which in this case is the first of the 3 vaults. Once you’ve deposited your funds you’re done!</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 6\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11091/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_6.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 774px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Badges &amp; Boosts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that you’ve deposited your funds, head over to the <a href=\"https://app.mitosis.org/expedition/dashboard?asset=weETH\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mitosis dashboard</a>, there are various badges and multipliers you can claim here for additional points.

For example, users who hold well-known NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins or reach particular milestones in Ether.fi may qualify for additional rewards.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11094/content_Mitosis_Boosters_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 532px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To claim these bonuses you must first join the official Mitosis <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/mitosis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> as the verification process is conducted there. After completing the usual Discord verifications, head to the “#role-verify” channel.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Click <strong>“Let’s Go!”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11095/content_Mitosis_Boosters_2.webp\" style=\"width: 917px; height: 551px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then <strong>“Add a New Wallet”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11096/content_Mitosis_Boosters_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 569px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Follow the provided instructions and connect your wallet to the Discord bot. Once that’s done return to the Mitosis dashboard and click <strong>“Check Eligibility”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 4\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11097/content_Mitosis_Boosters_4.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 494px;\"></div>\n\n<p>You will be redirected to authorize Mitosis to connect to your Discord account. Simply click <strong>\"Authorize\"</strong> to complete the process. If your wallet qualifies for any bonuses, you will receive the points immediately, and the community tab will update from <strong>“Info”</strong> to <strong>“Claimed”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 5\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11098/content_Mitosis_Boosters_5.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 571px;\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 6\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11099/content_Mitosis_Boosters_6.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 449px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Mitosis team has promised to do an airdrop, you should not rely solely on a single airdrop in your airdrop farming strategy. Mitosis presents a unique opportunity to farm multiple airdrops at once, giving you some diversification if you do this. However, as Mitosis is still a relatively new product with EOL not fully launching yet, I advise you to do your own research <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/dyor-with-crypto-fundamental-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">(DYOR)</a> before following through on this as the Mitosis vault is not immune to smart contract exploits.</p>"

In today's case study, we will explore some of the most popular crypto wallets in the market, and how they utilize <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/api?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko API</a> to enhance its product and offering.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is a Crypto Wallet and Why is it Needed?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A crypto wallet allows users to securely manage their cryptocurrencies, send and receive transactions on the blockchain, and monitor their balance. While it does not store actual cryptocurrency, crypto wallets hold the public and private keys necessary to conduct transactions on a network. The public key acts like an account number that can be shared to receive funds, while the private key serves as a password that authorizes access to the user's assets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wide selection of crypto wallets in the market, most of which support hundreds or even thousands of cryptocurrencies. These wallets come in two main types: <strong>hot wallets</strong>, which are connected to the Internet, and <strong>cold wallets</strong> that remain offline. Many wallets can also hold various types of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and connect directly to exchanges for the buying and selling of crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto wallets are essential for several critical functions, such as:</p>\n\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li role=\"presentation\">Allowing users to monitor their crypto assets’ balance</li>\n\t<li role=\"presentation\">Send and receive cryptocurrency payments</li>\n\t<li role=\"presentation\">Connect and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain</li>\n\t<li role=\"presentation\">Helping users manage the private encryption keys needed to access and transact with their cryptocurrency</li>\n\t<li role=\"presentation\">Enable transactions using public key addresses on the blockchain, which can be associated with usernames for easier identification</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><img alt=\"Top Crypto Wallets Using Crypto API - CoinGecko API\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11038/content_Top_Crypto_Wallets_Using_CoinGecko_API_-_casestudy.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Top Crypto Wallets Using CoinGecko API</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many crypto wallets leverage CoinGecko API to display aggregated real-time crypto price and market data within their wallet's user interface (UI).

Staking users benefit from discounts on transaction fees for swaps made through the wallet, and can earn tokens. A portion of the trading fees is allocated to the community treasury, allowing stakers to participate in the ecosystem's governance.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"XDefi Wallet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11058/content_content_3eff66e2-4217-4e0f-af48-271875152574_1.webp\" style=\"width: 391px; height: 593px;\"></p>\n\n<h2>Ledger</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ledger-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-review?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">Ledger wallets</a> provide a secure method for storing cryptocurrency keys offline, safeguarding them from remote access by hackers. By storing private keys on a secure element chip in dedicated, secure hardware, Ledger ensures that your sensitive information remains protected. As one of the most trusted solutions in the industry, Ledger’s multi-currency hardware wallets are a top choice for secure crypto management.</p>\n\n<p>Ledger currently offers three primary hardware wallet models: Ledger Stax, Ledger Flex, and the Ledger Nano range. All models are hardware wallets that enable users to send, receive, and manage their crypto assets securely using Ledger Live – plus stake crypto to earn rewards, swap crypto assets, and connect to fiat on-ramps easily. Additionally, Ledger integrates with over 50 software wallets (like the ones covered above), offering extensive compatibility.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"ledger cold wallet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11068/content_Screenshot_2024-08-28_at_1.06.27%E2%80%AFPM.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 573px;\"></p>\n\n<p>A key security feature of Ledger wallets is its ability to perform key calculations directly on the device's secure element, ensuring that your root key never leaves the device. This approach protects against potential viruses or spyware on your computer. Moreover, Ledger requires physical confirmation for each transaction, meaning you must press a button on the device to authorize any transfer, adding an extra layer of security.</p>\n\n<p>In case of loss or theft, Ledger wallets provide a 24-word backup recovery code. This code allows users to regain access to their cryptocurrencies, ensuring that their assets remain secure even if the physical device is compromised.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Popular CoinGecko API Endpoints Used in Crypto Wallets</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After exploring the features of top-performing crypto wallets above, let's unpack how these wallets display accurate crypto market data and its commonly used API endpoints.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>1. Coins List with Market Data – <a href=\"http://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/coins/markets</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The<strong> /coins/markets </strong>endpoint is essential for retrieving comprehensive market data on specific coins or groups of coins, such as live crypto prices, market capitalization, FDV, trading volume, 24 hour price change, circulating supply, total supply, and so on. Most crypto wallets use this feature to display relevant coin information, helping users make informed decisions based on real-time market data.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The endpoint delivers detailed market information with high granularity, customizable through optional parameters. Additionally, the provided pagination options allow for efficient data management.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Coin Data by ID – <a href=\"http://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/coins/{id}</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While market data is crucial, having a detailed list that maps each coin by id, name and symbol is equally important. The <strong>/coins/{id}</strong> endpoint offers extensive data on any coin by simply passing its unique ID as a parameter. This helps users better understand the assets they are managing.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Coin Historical Chart Data by ID – <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-market-chart?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/coins/{id}/market_chart</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historical data is vital for users who want to analyze a coin's performance over time. The<strong> /coins/{id}/market_chart</strong> endpoint provides the historical chart data of a coin, including price, market cap and 24-hour volume, based on a given coin ID. Adjust to the desired data granularity with the 'days' and 'interval' query parameters.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. NFTs Collection Data by ID – <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/nfts-id?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/nfts/{id}</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For wallets that support NFTs, displaying information about specific NFTs is crucial. The <strong>/nfts/{id} </strong>endpoint allows the wallet application to retrieve comprehensive data about a particular NFT collection by passing its NFT ID as a parameter. The response will include the NFT collection name, symbol, image (as a URL), description, and market data like NFT collection floor price, market cap, 24-hour trading volume, price change percentage, the number of unique addresses, among other data.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This returned data is highly granular and can be customized with optional parameters.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. NFTs List with Market Data – <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/nfts-markets?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/nfts/markets</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">To retrieve extensive market data for all supported NFT collections on CoinGecko, utilize this<strong> /nfts/markets</strong> endpoint. Similar to /nfts/{ids}, the data returned will include market data like floor prices, market cap, volume, 24-hour price/volume/market cap change in percentage, and other market-related data. Developers may specify pagination values as a parameter, to manage and retrieve data more efficiently.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Scale Your Project with CoinGecko API</h2>\n\n<p>When developing a crypto wallet, it is important to focus on the availability and reliability of data displayed to the user, especially data like coin prices and other market parameters.

We’ll look at some common queries around EVM and Sei native addresses and transactions.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EVM vs. Sei Addresses</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After linking your EVM wallet via the wallet-linking portal, you receive a second address; this is a Sei native address. Your EVM address (that starts with 0x) and SEI address (that starts with Sei1) are connected to each other. During the wallet creation process, the protocol generates a native SEI address using your wallet's public key. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both addresses will still point to the same account on the Sei ledger. Depending on the application you are using, only one of the wallets will be shown, but your balances on both wallets will be the same and every transaction will be recognized. That is, if you are visiting a native Sei dApp, your Sei address will be automatically used, and your EVM address will be used to connect to EVM dApps. Both addresses can be used as the recipient address when transferring funds to your wallet.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out our article on other <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-sei-wallets?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sei Network wallets available</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EVM Transactions vs. Sei Native Transactions</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key difference between a Sei EVM transaction and a native Sei transaction is on the backend operation. From the user's perspective, both transactions feel the same. A native Sei transaction targets a Sei pre-compiled contract while an EVM transaction assumes the normal sequence of other EVM transactions. To enable users to run both transactions from their MetaMask wallet, the dApp smart contract developer will need to adjust the application to ensure that MetaMask transactions target the precompiled contract.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sei V2’s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-parallelization-parallel-execution-blockchain?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">parallelized</a> EVM adopts the smart contract execution system used by the Ethereum network to improve its performance and cost-effectiveness. The dual network architecture means that the native Sei and the EVM side of Sei Network exist as an efficiently connected system. Network users now will be able to easily alternate between both systems and access a wider range of dApps.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only meant to provide users with a guide to adding Sei Network to their MetaMask wallet, and is not intended to provide users with an exhaustive list of operations they can perform with their MetaMask wallets.

A major bottleneck for developers and application users is the availability of hardware and software computing resources: CPU and GPU power.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most of these resources are supplied by centralized corporations via cloud computing facilities; however, these tend to be more expensive, require long-term contracts, and may also have waitlists for the most popular hardware. Io.net, a Solana-based compute resource project, is focused on unlocking fair access to computing power to empower ML applications by creating a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/depin-crypto-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)</a> focusing on GPU power.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Introducing io.net</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net is a compute resource network that offers GPU power to organizations and individuals developing machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and products. According to the project, it offers developers unlimited GPU power, better pricing, and flexibility. Io.net achieves this by developing a model that allows idle GPUs to be put to good use, tapping into over one million GPUs from independent data centers, crypto miners, and other crypto projects that rent out idle GPU power like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-render-network-rndr-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Render</a>. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By leveraging a user-friendly portal for users to access this dormant GPU supply, along with rewarding GPU suppliers, io.net positions itself as a marketplace for idle GPU power. This enables it to garner more GPU power than organizations that rely on centralized self-managed data centers and facilities to provide computing power for their clients.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net cites the tremendous growth in software development, the increasing relevance of Machine Learning (ML) and AI model development, and the challenges faced by builders in this space, especially self-funded projects and projects based in certain regions. These challenges are related to accessibility, security, and affordability. By deploying its solution on the blockchain, io.net lowers the barrier for GPU suppliers and companies via a permissionless portal; and by distributing the financial load of providing GPU power to the network to the different suppliers, it reduces the overall facility cost and in turn the cost of obtaining GPU power from the network. Data from the project suggests that io.net’s pricing is at least 50% cheaper than its centralized competitors.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Team Background</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The io.net team was inspired to develop a cheaper and more accessible source of computing resources by the high prices of NVIDIA cards required to deploy their High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithm using Ray.io. Since this time, the team has rebranded from Antbit to io.net and transitioned from developing institutional-grade quantitative trading systems to developing a decentralized market for computing resources, mainly for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) model developers.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The io.net team was founded and previously led by Ahmad Shadid, former quant systems engineer at WhalesTrader and Arabfolio and volunteer contributor at Ethereum Foundation. Co-founder and former COO Tory Green has assumed leadership following Ahmad’s stepping down on June 11, 2024. Members of the project team include:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tory Green, Co-founder and CEO</strong>: Tory Green, a Stanford University graduate, is the current CEO of Io.net and former COO at Tiller Partners and HUM capital.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Basem Oubah, Co-founder and COS</strong>: Basem Oubah is an Engineering graduate from Yildiz Teknik University 2022. He is the Chief of Staff of io.net.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gaurav Sharma, CTO</strong>: Gaurav Sharma held positions at Binance, Agoda, Amazon, and eBay. He is the current Chief Technical Officer at io.net.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Garrison Yang, CMO</strong>: Garrison Yang is the Chief Marketing Officer at io.net, he held a growth leadership position at Ava Labs and advisory positions at Pulsar Games, 77-bit, and Legendary Foundry Games.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Smiral Rashinkar, VP of Engineering</strong>: Smiral Rashinkar is a machine learning engineer. He is the VP of engineering at io.net and has held engineering positions at Koo and Rivi.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Funding</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net announced that it has raised $30 million in its Series A funding program at a valuation of $1 billion. The funding round was led by Hack VC, with participation from Multicoin Capital, 6th Man Ventures, Solana Ventures, OKX Ventures, Aptos Labs, Delphi Digital, and The Sandbox. Individual angel investors in the projects include Yat Siu of Animoca Brands, Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana Labs, and Mo Shaik of Aptos Labs.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s take a closer look at how io.net works.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How io.net Works</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a nutshell, io.net offers suppliers a marketplace to rent out their idle computing resources to developers who are looking to obtain on-demand computing resources. By using the blockchain, io.net creates a transparent platform for computing power management. As io.net operates on an hourly basis, where users can book clusters for specific periods, io.net utilizes its unique Proof concept: Proof of Time-Lock, which proves that the GPUs were not accessed by any other services that would impact compute power during the time it was rented. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Work on io.net is priced according to presiding factors like workload and availability of computing resources. The facility also ranks suppliers according to their security compliance and upload/download speed, which also affects the pricing. The platform’s economy is built on the IO token. Suppliers are rewarded for works processed using the computing resources using IO tokens, while developers can also pay for resources obtained from the network with IO tokens.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net Architecture</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net is a multi-layered network, each layer plays a role in the network’s operation. These layers include;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The user interface</strong>: Suppliers, users, and node operators on the network can manage their operations via their respective user interfaces, which are designed to suit the needs of each type of user.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The security layer</strong>: The security safeguards the facility. It consists of firewall protection for network protection, user authentication services, and logging services for tracking network activities.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>API layer</strong>: The API layer enables connectivity with external platforms and some internal operations. It includes public APIs for websites and private APIs for internal operations.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Backend layer</strong>: The backend layer is the core of the network. It manages major operations like cluster/GPU operations, customer interactions, fault monitoring, analytics, billing, and resource usage.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Database layer</strong>: Consists of main storage for storing structured data and caching for storing temporary and frequently accessed data.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Message broker/task layer</strong>: Manages the task flow on the network via communication portals for suppliers and workers.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Infrastructure layer</strong>: The infrastructure layer houses the compute resources on the network. It manages deployments and task operations.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform layers are the core of the network and enable io.net’s products to function.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net Products</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let's look at the different products in the io.net lineup. Before you can access any of these products, you'll first need to create an IO ID. IO ID is the control center for the IO Ecosystem. To access io.net, you'll need an IO ID. Users will need to sign up with either Google, Apple, X, or Worldcoin and connect either a Solana or Aptos wallet for future payments and withdrawals. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">IO Worker</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IO Worker is the software node client for GPU suppliers on the IO network. It enables suppliers to set up their accounts, lend idle GPU power, and manage the resources they contribute to the network. GPU suppliers will also be able to monitor how their GPU is utilized and the earnings from these operations as well.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"IO Worker\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10954/content_unnamed_%2868%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1593px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">IO Cloud</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IO Cloud is a decentralized cloud computing facility for ML and AI model developers. It creates a connection between compute resource suppliers and developers, allowing developers to access computing resources on-demand. Here, users can monitor their jobs, including the list of workers, type of GPU/CPU used, the remaining compute hours, and more.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"IO Cloud\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10955/content_unnamed_%2869%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1151px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">IO Explorer</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IO Explorer gives the user an overview of the network, ranging from the number of verified GPUs and CPUs, the kind of chips available in the different countries, and the quantity and pricing of the chips available. It also features updates on the blocks computed, and rewards emitted. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"IO Explorer\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10956/content_unnamed_%2870%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 901px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and AI</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rising demand for AI products and the progression in the abilities of AI algorithms have caused a correspondingl rise in demand for infrastructures required to develop these products. However, io.net notes that traditional setups cannot meet up with these demands or cater to the needs of smaller developers. With its approach to sourcing compute power primarily for AI and ML model developers, it hopes to give developers who use its facility an edge. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net’s distributed computing allows AI and ML developers to run their applications across multiple cores, in parallel, leveraging diverse computing resources and optimizing the performance of their applications. Using IO-SDK, a fork of Ray.io, developers can easily employ the io.net facility to scale their operations through parallel computing. The IO-SDK is designed to be user-friendly, enabling developers to accurately use the infrastructures developed by the project.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net describes itself as a cheaper, more available, scalable, and more secure option to traditional cloud computing services, especially for AI model developers who require more advanced hardware and software capabilities.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's take a look at how io.net supports different stages of AI and ML model development.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Training</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI model training is a data-intensive procedure. This is because AI models are structured for their specific operations using inferences from huge amounts of data. Io.net enables developers to parallelize this process by exporting the architecture and weights of a trained model across a network of distributed GPUs. Io.net’s parallel computing enables faster and more quality inferences and generally optimal training through the abundance of resources and batched processing across multiple cores. This is in contrast to the sequential computing model used in traditional training procedures.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tuning</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI models undergo regular modifications to adjust to newer principles or optimize performance. Refining an AI model ensures that it not only maintains peak performance but also that it aligns with the user/developers’ goals. Fine-tuning an AI model involves searching through several hyperparameter settings. Like the training procedure, this is also a data-intensive procedure and benefits from distributed computing. Io.net leverages distributed computing libraries with advanced hyperparameter tuning for this procedure. It enables developers to easily discover and use the best hyperparameter setting for the AI models.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">IO Token and Tokenomics</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/io-net\" target=\"_blank\">IO token</a> is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/spl-solana-token-standards?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">SPL</a> standard token minted on the Solana network, and also serves as the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-vs-utility-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">utility token</a> of io.net. According to the project, it is the currency of compute required to keep the facility running. While developers can pay for resources obtained from the network in USDC and other accepted tokens (including IO), GPU suppliers on the network are paid in IO tokens only. Developers paying for GPU usage with the IO token enjoy certain benefits like zero or reduced transaction fees. A 2% transaction fee is applied to payments in any other token. IO holders can also earn extra income by staking their tokens on the network’s nodes. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A total of 800 million IO tokens will be minted on the Solana network. The circulating supply at launch will be 500 million tokens. 300 million tokens will be reserved for rewards to suppliers for jobs completed using their GPU, which will be distributed hourly over the course of 20 years. About 32 million IO tokens have also been distributed to participants of the ignition rewards program and the project’s social campaigns. IO token currently trades on decentralized exchanges on the Solana blockchain and centralized exchanges like Kucoin, MEXC, and Gate exchange. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and Decentralized Computing</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s look at how io.net compares against other decentralized compute projects in the blockchain and crypto space. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net vs. Akash Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like io.net, Akash network also presents a platform for idle GPU owners to provide computational resources to users. Akash uses a reverse auction system to ensure competitive pricing, where network deployers specify their preferred price, and providers compete to fulfill the request. This lets them offer lower costs and greater choice. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Akash ecosystem is supported by validators who maintain network security and integrity by staking the network’s native token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/akash-network\" target=\"_blank\">AKT</a>. AKT is also used for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">governance</a>, as well as for facilitating lease settlements. Other whitelisted tokens can also be used, but AKT is used as a unit of measure for settlements in these currencies. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, io.net uses a specified pricing model to set the prices of resources on its network. The price paid for GPU obtained from io.net depends on the availability of GPU during that period, the workload, and also the GPU specs (this is determined by their security compliance, device specifications, and upload/download speed). Also io.net is meant specifically for AI and ML model developers. While users can be from other sectors, the facility is built on AI and ML frameworks and optimized for this sector as well.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and Render Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before Render Network announced that it would be supporting works from AI and ML model developers, Render was meant for graphics rendering works as the project’s name suggests. Like io.net, it sources GPU power by allowing device owners to join the network and allow clients to render videos and graphics using their GPU. It also operates via a general pricing model, which is similar to that used by io.net. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, Render has a multi-tier pricing structure which is based on speed, security, cost, and node reputation. The higher the tier, the higher the cost, as seen in the table below. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Render Multi-Tier Pricing\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10957/content_unnamed_%2871%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1070px; height: 362px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lease settlement is only available in RENDER on Render Network, while io.net offers a wider range of cryptocurrencies for payment.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The major difference between io.net and Render networks is the purpose they are built for. Io.net is built with AI and ML model developers in mind, the facility is optimized for their operations. On the other hand, the Render network is a multi-purpose facility, built initially to handle video rendering operations and then adjusted to support AI and ML works. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a side note, Render has also partnered with io.net, adding its network of distributed GPU suppliers to io.net. Io.net has allocated 300,000 RENDER to its Early Suppliers Incentive Program.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Our partnership with the Render Network will give us access to Render’s community of quality consumer-grade GPUs while we expand their nodes’ use cases beyond rendering to ML applications. This partnership will strengthen both of our offerings, and we look forward to work together. We are excited to launch at Breakpoint and expand to meet the needs of the incredible growth of AI and ML.“</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">— Ahmad Shadid, CEO of io.net</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and Bittensor</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittensor\" target=\"_blank\">Bittensor</a> uses a challenge-based approach to select the best resources for AI and ML developers, which is also known as “Proof of Intelligence”. Participants on the networks run a node on a subnet, and workers on the network are informed of the task while they work towards a solution. Validators review the solutions and generate a challenge to score the different miners’ solutions. This can be applied to diverse tasks like the development of an AI or ML model to solve a problem or even the provision of computing resources for AI and ML model developers. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bittensor is a diverse network and not limited to the provision of computing power. In contrast, io.net specializes in sourcing compute resources for AI and ML. The main similarity between io.net and Bittensor is their relevance in AI and ML development. The pricing structure on io.net is defined by the network for the general supplier pool; meanwhile, on Bittensor, subnet owners specify the reward structure for each task and selected participants are rewarded accordingly. However, payment for tasks performed is made using the utility tokens of the networks (IO and TAO).</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developers building Machine Learning (ML), AI models, and other advanced computing protocols will definitely benefit from readily available computing resources. This is the vision of io.net and other projects in this sector. Decentralizing such solutions using the blockchain makes for easy access for developers and easy management for providers and the general facility. It presents an avenue for proper utilization of globally available computing power by turning dormant GPUs into functional and revenue-generating assets. Even in its earliest stage, a handful of projects are already adopting io.net. As the project continues to develop, we could see even more adoption of the project or its approach to decentralizing provision and access to computing power.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having said this, note that this article only reviews io.net for educational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.

This means that you — as a liquidity provider — had incurred losses at the current price ratio of the pooled assets, compared to when you deposited tokens to the pool to provide liquidity. The term \"impermanent\" comes from the fact that these losses are unrealized and only become permanent when assets are withdrawn from the pool. Moreover, the loss will be reversed if the token prices return to their original deposit prices, and the price ratio returns to its initial value.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Calculate Impermanent Loss</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Calculating impermanent loss involves understanding how price changes affect the value of assets within the pool. For an easy and more precise calculation, you can use the CoinGecko <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/impermanent-loss-calculator\" target=\"_blank\">Impermanent Loss Calculator</a>. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Risks of Impermanent Loss</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent loss is an ever present risk when contributing to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity pools</a>, particularly for volatile assets. The degree of impermanent loss often increases with the volatility of the pooled assets. While <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/earn-passive-income-with-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">trading fees or incentives earned</a> from the liquidity pool can offset impermanent loss, they might not always fully compensate for it, especially during extreme price movements.  Liquidity providers should not consider providing liquidity as a form of passive income; rather they should be monitoring and managing their positions actively to avoid losses. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Manage Impermanent Loss</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent loss can't entirely be avoided; however, several strategies can help liquidity providers manage it. Here are some key strategies to consider.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Choose Stable Asset Pairs </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You reduce the risk of impermanent loss by providing liquidity with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-stablecoins-top-5-stablecoins-by-market-cap\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins</a> or other low-volatility assets, which are less likely to experience significant price fluctuations. For example, pairing USDC/USDT or DAI/USDC can minimize the risk of loss since these stablecoins are designed to track the value of the US dollar.  One effective strategy for managing impermanent loss, without relying on stable asset pairs, is to use correlated assets for liquidity provision. For instance, pairing stETH/ETH, this way you can enjoy the higher yields of liquidity provision in a volatile asset with lower risks of impermanent loss.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Multiple Asset Pools</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spreading your assets across multiple liquidity pools can help reduce the impact of impermanent losses. By not putting all your funds into a single pool, you curtail the overall risk to your crypto portfolio.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Use Impermanent Loss Protection</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent Loss Protection (ILP) is a feature offered by some <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) platforms to act as insurance against impermanent losses. ILP compensates you if the value of your pooled assets drops below a certain threshold due to price fluctuations. Ultimately, this protection helps mitigate the financial impact of impermanent loss. It is especially useful in volatile markets where the risk of significant price changes is higher.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Monitor Market Conditions </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stay informed about market trends and the performance of your chosen assets pools. If the market becomes particularly volatile, you can consider temporarily withdrawing your assets to avoid significant impermanent loss.</p>"

They an already existing blockchain rapidly process more transactions at a lower cost by handling operations off-chain, at the same time inheriting the security provided by the underlying Layer 1 network. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Do We Need Layer 2s?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most Layer 1 blockchains have limitations, ranging from high transaction fees, slow processing times, and limited overall efficiency. However, attempts to singlehandedly address these challenges often led to other issues, such as centralization, weakened security, and so on. This dilemma brought the innovation of Layer 2 solutions, which aim to tackle the technical constraints of parent Layer 1 networks, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a>. There are also specific decentralized applications that are very performance / blockspace intensive and want to have their own chain instead of using a shared network. Here are reasons why Layer 2 blockchains are important in the cryptocurrency space.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Scalability</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Layer 1 network, like Ethereum, can only process a limited number of transactions at a given time. However, Layer 2 networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync, enhance Ethereum’s scalability by processing transactions off-chain or through other mechanisms like rollups.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Reduced Congestion</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Layer 2 networks offer faster transaction times by handling transactions off the parent chain, rolling up a bundle of transactions into a single fraud proof that is published on the Layer 1. As more users transact on Layer 2s instead of the base Layer 1, they help minimize congestion on the Layer 1 network.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lower Transaction Costs</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Increased network traffic — especially during peak usage periods — often leads to higher transaction fees on most popular blockchains. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-2\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2 solutions</a> help to lower transaction costs by enhancing network efficiency and minimizing congestion.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> if you’re interested to find out more about Layer 2s and its latest happenings!</p>"

          "__text": "<h2>What Are Automated Market Makers (AMMs)?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AMMs are a type of protocol designed to facilitate the trading of digital assets and the setting of asset prices on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange-dex\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized exchanges</a> (DEXs). Instead of matching buyers and sellers as in traditional order books, AMMs utilize liquidity pools and mathematical algorithms for trade execution and price determination. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Do AMMs Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Typically, a market maker refers to an entity (firm or individual) who facilitates the process of liquidity provision by submitting both bid and ask orders for a specific asset on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-centralized-crypto-exchanges-cex\" target=\"_blank\">centralized exchanges</a>. Crypto market makers place orders around the prevailing market price of the token at the time, in order to increase the chances of traders’ orders being matched. These entities help maintain the efficiency and fluidity of a centralized exchange’s trading system. Now, the operation of traditional market makers forms the core of AMMs’ mechanism, except that the latter is automated and uses individual liquidity providers (LPs). Automated market makers provide liquidity through <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contracts</a> — self-executing protocols — commonly called liquidity pools. Instead of trading against counterparties, users trade against the liquidity pools — a reservoir of tokens supplied by the LPs — on AMM platforms. For example, if a DEX user wanted to exchange Ether (ETH) for Tether (USDT), they would need to find the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-trading-pairs-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\">ETH/USDT</a> liquidity pool on the automated market maker. The “market price” of the trade depends on the relative ratio of the amount of tokens within the liquidity pool. Using the earlier example, a pool with 1ETH and 3000USDT would represent an ETH price of $3,000. Trades executed on the pool would shift this ratio, representing shifts in the market price.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Benefits of Automated Market Makers</h2>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Decreased Liquidity Requirements</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary advantage of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model is its significantly lower liquidity requirements compared to traditional order book systems. AMMs can support smooth trading with just a fraction of the liquidity needed in traditional markets. This is important because as a novel industry the amount of liquidity in cryptocurrency markets is limited.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Decentralization</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Automated market makers eliminate the need for intermediaries and third-party custodians, enabling users to retain control of their assets. This aligns with the decentralized ethos of the cryptocurrency industry, ensuring a trustless and permissionless trading ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lower Entry Barrier</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In centralized trading platforms, only high-net-worth entities are able to provide liquidity through “market making.” Automated market makers, on the other hand, can accept trades and even liquidity provisioning regardless of the amount. Moreover, there are decent incentives attached to being an LP on AMMs.</p>"

        "content": {
          "_type": "html",
          "__text": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Total Value Locked (TVL)?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Total value locked (TVL) is a cryptocurrency metric used to measure the total value of digital assets locked or staked on a particular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform or decentralized application (dApp). These assets can include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT). TVL is usually expressed in US dollars, for easy comparisons across different blockchain platforms or protocols. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Is TVL Important?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TVL serves as a key indicator of the overall health, and popularity of a DeFi blockchain or decentralized application.  Typically, a consistently high TVL suggests a robust and stable decentralized application that has strong utility, as well as the trust and faith of its users. These factors can contribute to the overall success of the application as they attract more participants.  Conversely, a lower TVL can signal reduced capital availability, potentially resulting in less attractive conditions for participants.  TVL also helps in identifying a project’s market share, as a higher total value locked in DeFi is indicative of a project’s dominance in the space. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Is TVL Calculated?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The calculation of TVL — as the name implies —  simply involves summing up the digital assets locked in a specific protocol at a given time. These assets could range from cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, liquidity tokens, and so on. For example, a decentralized protocol with $125 million in staked ETH, $56 million in wrapped Bitcoin, and $20 million in other <a href=\"https://dev.to/envoy_/ks-what-are-ethereum-request-for-comments-erc-standards-5f80\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ERC-standard tokens</a> will have a total value locked of approximately $201 million. Several DeFi analytics platforms and data aggregator sites offer real-time TVL, and they include; <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko</a>, DeFiLlama, L2BEAT, etc. That said, it is worth noting that TVL can fluctuate with the market value of its locked assets, meaning that the total value locked on a platform may change even if no new assets are deposited or withdrawn.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Limitations of TVL</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While TVL is a widely used metric in the DeFi space, it still has its limitations. TVL provides insight into the amount of capital locked in a platform, but some components can affect its reliability and accuracy. Below are some of these problems.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Market Fluctuations</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TVL is sensitive to the market value of the underlying assets. A rise or fall in the price of cryptocurrencies like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> can significantly alter a platform's TVL, even without new deposits or withdrawals. This can give a misleading picture of the platform's growth and stability.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Manipulation</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In some cases, TVL can be artificially inflated by actors looking to attract attention to their platform. This manipulation can mislead investors into overestimating the security or popularity of a DeFi project.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Multiple Counting</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The total value locked on a chain can be overstated if the same assets are used across multiple platforms. For instance, assets staked in one protocol might be counted again if they are used as collateral in another (on the same chain), leading to inflated TVL figures.</p>"

These wallets generate seed phrases and store <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-public-and-private-keys\" target=\"_blank\">private keys online</a>. However, the fact that the private keys are stored online is also one potential risk associated with cryptocurrency hot wallets. This constant internet access makes hot wallets relatively more vulnerable to hacks and exploits than cold storage options. Despite this risk, hot wallets are an ideal storage medium for users who frequently receive and send cryptocurrencies. There are two types of hot wallets, and they include the exchange-based (custodial) wallets and software (non-custodial) wallets.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Hot Wallet vs Cold Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When deciding between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/hot-wallet-vs-cold-wallet\" target=\"_blank\">a hot wallet and a cold wallet</a>, it is essential to understand how each option fits your needs.  For instance, hot wallets are convenient for frequent transactions. They are typically software-based, and, as a result, accessible through devices like smartphones or computers, enabling the effective management of a crypto portfolio. Examples include; MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, etc. In contrast, cold wallets are hardware devices that store private keys offline, offering an increased level of security. These wallets are not connected to the internet, which curtails the risk of exploits. However, the devices do need an internet connection when funds need to be accessed. Cold wallets are ideal for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies, and they include; Trezor, Ledger, ELLIPAL, etc.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Pro Tip</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While hot wallets offer ease of access and convenience, cold wallets provide robust security for long-term asset storage. Advance users store most of their token holdings on cold wallets, and only leave certain holdings on hot wallets for trading / active use. For a balanced approach, you can also consider integrating both cold and hot wallets. Connect your cold hardware wallet, such as a Ledger, to a hot wallet. This setup requires each hot wallet transaction to be approved through your cold wallet, combining the convenience of hot wallets with the security of cold storage.</p>"

The project aims to build a platform where BTC assets can flow across blockchain networks to unify Bitcoin’s liquidity and amplify its utility. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin (BTC)</a> holders are unable to deploy their assets on other blockchains, resulting in idle BTC. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Decentralized Bitcoin Reserve is built on three pillars in order to address various aspects needed to create a comprehensive and compliant product. First is the Liquidity Consensus Network (LCN) which serves as the operational core to manage liquidity and ensure smooth cross-chain interactions. The LCN provides dynamic liquidity management by handling and managing Bitcoin within the reserve. It also supports the transfer of Bitcoin assets across different blockchain networks and integrates liquidity from diverse sources. On top of that, the LCN operates with transparent and auditable records as well as regular reporting to provide transparency and network safety. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second pillar is Solv Protocol’s implementation of UTXO-3525, a protocol that maps Bitcoin transactions to the ERC-3525 standard. This protocol enables the transfer of Bitcoin-related assets such as BTC, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-ordinals-nft?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ordinals</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Runes</a> from the Bitcoin chain to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">EVM</a>-compatible networks. By mapping these transfers, users can enjoy features like uncollateralized borrowing and enhanced liquidity for Bitcoin assets. UTXO-3525 is also meant to support the reserve’s scalability by accommodating growing demand.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Facilitating traditional finance integration via the compliance bridge is the third and final pillar of the reserve. It focuses on creating an infrastructure that encourages traditional financial institutions to participate by implementing a compliant infrastructure. This includes efforts such as the tokenization of BTC ETFs as well as comprehensive reporting and auditing capabilities that can meet the requirements of traditional finance participants. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SolvBTC is a Liquid Yield token kept in the reserves and backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. Users who participate on Solv Protocol can earn yield with SolvBTC by utilizing yield vaults or exploring DeFi opportunities. Depositing SolvBTC into Yield Vaults provides access to BTC Staking, Restaking, and Delta-Neutral Trading strategies. Meanwhile, SolvBTC can also be staked and converted into liquid staking tokens such as SolvBTC.BBN and SolvBTC.ENA. It is currently deployed on five major networks including Bitcoin mainnet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> mainnet, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/binance-smart-chain\" target=\"_blank\">BNB</a> chain. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solv Protocol has successfully raised $16 million across five funding rounds and is backed by prominent investors including Binance Labs, Blockchain Capital, Laser Digital, and more. The protocol has also undergone security audits by various firms such as Quantstamp, Certik SlowMist, Salus, and Secbit.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested users can now participate in the Solv Points system to earn points by holding SolvBTC and interacting with the SolvBTC ecosystem. Given the growing interest in deploying Bitcoin assets across other chains, now is a good time to explore the Solv Protocol ecosystem and earn points!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do take note that at the time of writing, the Solv Protocol team has not made any official announcements regarding a token launch. Therefore, participating in the Solv Points system by following the steps below does not guarantee a future token airdrop allocation. </strong></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Connect Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, head over to <a href=\"https://app.solv.finance/points\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.solv.finance/points</a> and <strong>Connect your wallet</strong> either on the main screen or in the top right corner.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Connect wallet to Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10973/content_1._Connect_wallet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 656px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a few wallet options to choose from and in this guide, we will be using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask\" target=\"_blank\">MetaMask</a>. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do make sure that whichever wallet you select has a form of BTC asset such as WBTC on Arbitrum or FBTC on Ethereum as well as enough ETH to cover gas fees.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Select wallet to connect to Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10974/content_1.1_wallet_options.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 656px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Get SolvBTC</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that your wallet is connected, it is time to get some SolvBTC!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the top menu bar, head over to <strong>SolvBTC</strong> on the left.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"SolvBTC\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10975/content_2._SolvBTC.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 656px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here you can choose which network you want to deposit your BTC asset from. In this guide, we are depositing WBTC on the Arbitrum chain. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Input your deposit amount, <strong>Approve</strong> it, and <strong>Confirm</strong> the transaction in your wallet. You will then receive SolvBTC.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding SolvBTC is the easiest way to receive Solv Points and the following steps are optional for those who are not comfortable interacting with various protocols. However, do consider the amount of XP you can earn as it varies depending on each step.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Deposit BTC for SolvBTC \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10976/content_2.1_deposit.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 616px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Stake SolvBTC (Optional)</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After receiving your SolvBTC, you can proceed to stake it. At the time of writing, the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-babylon-crypto-bitcoin-staking?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Babylon</a> campaign is currently paused, therefore we are unable to receive SOLVBTC.BB and will proceed with the SolvBTC Ethena campaign.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do note that this step is optional as you are required to perform the Know Your Customer (KYC) process which some users may prefer not to. You can still earn Solv Points from holding SolvBTC. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the top menu, move over to the <strong>SolvBTC.ENA</strong> page where you will need to <strong>Verify your identity</strong>. Clicking this will redirect you to the Synaps page.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Verify identity to stake SolvBTC\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10977/content_3._SolvBTC_ENA.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 616px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will need to provide your email address and wallet address to sign up for the KYC process. A verification code will be sent to your email for you to paste into the Synaps page.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"KYC process for Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10978/content_3.1_KYC_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 616px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, you need to perform a liveness test, in which your camera records your face moving closer to the camera and staying still. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then, you need to upload pictures of the front and back of a government document such as a passport or driving license. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once everything is submitted, it may take up to 24 hours for your documents to be reviewed and approved. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Solv KYC verification process\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10979/content_3.2_KYC.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 647px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Do note that at the time of writing, we were unable to proceed with staking in the Ethena campaign due to an issue regarding the verification process. However, this article will be updated once the issue has been resolved. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 4: Provide Liquidity </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Back in your top menu, head over to <strong>Liquidity</strong> to see the different DeFi protocols you can provide liquidity to. When browsing, do take into account which assets you need to have in order to participate such as SolvBTC, SolvBTC.BBN, and SolvBTC.ENA.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Provide liquidity on Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10980/content_4._Liquidity.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 655px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this guide we will continue with the Arbitrum network. As shown below, there are a few DeFi options under Arbitrum which require different assets. For example, on DODO you can stake SolvBTC-WBTC LP, SolvBTC-SolvBTC.ENA LP, or SolvBTC-SolvBTC.BBN LP. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As some of you may prefer to only hold on to SolvBTC, for this step we will go with the simplest option which is to supply SolvBTC on Avalon. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Supply SolvBTC\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10981/content_4.1_Options.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 597px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get Started</strong> with the option and be redirected to the Avalon page. Connect your wallet in order to supply your SolvBTC.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Supply SolvBTC on Avalon\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10982/content_4.2_Avalon.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 647px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Input the amount you want and <strong>Approve SolvBTC to continue.</strong></p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Approve SolvBTC\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10983/content_4.3_Approve.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 582px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, <strong>Supply SolvBTC</strong> and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Confirm supply SolvBTC\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10984/content_4.4_Supply.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 582px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 5: Discover the Yield Market</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the top menu, proceed to <strong>Yield Market</strong> to discover the various options there are on different chains. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will be looking at the Arbitrum chain.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Yield Market on Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10985/content_5._Yield_Market.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 654px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We highly recommend that you take the time to read and understand each opportunity so you are aware of the product itself.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the GMX V2 USDC-A has a risk management system that will liquidate and suspend the strategy for at least 14 days if the 30-day drawdown exceeds 3%. Users can then apply for redemption at any time during this period which will be processed on the 15th and 30th of each month.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Research opportunities for farming yield on Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10986/content_5.1_Info.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 577px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to participate, input how much USDC you want to pay and then <strong>Approve</strong> and <strong>Confirm</strong> the transaction.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Approve and confirm liquidity provision through Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10987/content_5.2_purchase.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 577px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solv Protocol aims to enhance yield and liquidity opportunities for bitcoin holders by enabling cross-chain interoperability and allowing BTC assets to be transferred on other blockchain networks. Users can now earn points when participating in the Solv Points system by holding SolvBTC and interacting with various yield opportunities on DeFi protocols.</p>"

This is done without the need for staked Bitcoins to be bridged, wrapped, pegged, or held in custody. It is able to achieve this by leveraging the three unique facets of Bitcoin: its timestamping service, blockspace, and asset value. The project aims to tap into security from Bitcoin, the pioneer blockchain platform, and disperse it to various PoS ecosystems, such as Cosmos, Polygon, and Bitcoin Layer 2s.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Team and Funding</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://babylonchain.io/about\">team behind Babylon</a> features key figures and prominent scholars, including co-founders David Tse and Fisher Yu. Babylon also has a team of advisors who provide expert guidance and strategic insights. The project's ecosystem is growing through various partnerships, including Lombard, Akash Network, Binance Web3 Wallet, Injective (INJ), Cosmos Hub, and OKX Wallet. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Babylon has received strong support and funding, reflecting significant market confidence in its innovative approach. For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/07/bitcoin-project-babylon-raises-18m-to-bolster-development-of-staking-protocol/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">project raised over $18 million</a> from top investors, including Polychain Capital, Hack VC, OKX Ventures, Polygon Ventures, and so on, in December 2023. This substantial investment is directed toward developing Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol, which aims to position Bitcoin as a decentralized staking asset. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a strong team and substantial funding, Babylon appears to be well-positioned in the market focused on integrating Bitcoin's security into decentralized finance (DeFi). Its unique staking protocol aims to broaden Bitcoin's utility and strengthen the security of PoS blockchains, demonstrating the project's commitment to on-chain integrity. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Does Babylon Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned earlier, Babylon is able to secure Proof-of-Stake chains by leveraging Bitcoin's three unique facets; timestamping service, blockspace, and asset value. These elements form the core of Babylon’s security-sharing protocols, which include the Bitcoin staking protocol, the Bitcoin timestamping protocol, and the Bitcoin data availability protocol. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These protocols work in tandem to ensure that Bitcoin's robust features are effectively utilized to bolster the security and efficiency of various PoS networks. Below is a detailed explanation of these protocols and how they work.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Staking Protocol</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin holders can use Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol on PoS chains, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-appchains-application-specific-blockchains?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">app chains</a>, and applications to protect the protocols and receive rewards by staking (and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-restaking-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">restaking</a>) their BTC. Unlike the conventional staking methods, the protocol eliminates the need for the staked Bitcoins to be bridged, wrapped, or held in third-party custody. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The staking protocol has two functions, which are somewhat interwoven. Primarily, it enhances the security of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/proof-of-stake-pos\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Stake chains</a> and applications through Bitcoin staking. Additionally, it incentivizes Bitcoin holders — through rewards — to participate in Babylon’s security model. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"What is Babylon crypto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10917/content_2024-08-08_15.31.06.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://babylonlabs.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-staking\" target=\"_blank\">Babylon</a></span></div>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the Babylon staking protocol claims that BTC deposited on the protocol are \"as safe as they can possibly be.\" For example, staked bitcoins are safe and withdrawable so long as the participant uses the protocol in good faith and does not attack the PoS chains. Moreover, Babylon claims the unbonding of the staked asset is generally safe and prompt without the need of social consensus, due to its use of the Bitcoin timestamping protocol which allows for synchronization between Bitcoin and the PoS chains.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All in all, the BTC staking protocol is designed as a modular plug-in compatible with various Proof-of-Stake chains. By integrating Bitcoin's robust security into these other blockchains, Babylon aims to expand BTC's utility beyond being merely a store of value or a medium of exchange.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Bitcoin timestamping protocol is another critical component of Babylon. This protocol operates by timestamping events of other blockchains onto the Bitcoin network, effectively borrowing BTC's security as a timestamping server. Basically, it allows any random data submitted to Babylon to obtain Bitcoin timestamps. </p>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Securing PoS chains using Bitcoin timestamping \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10916/content_HowUseCase-9eca05d99ca42eb4e0b5ee74c354176c.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 429px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://babylonlabs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Babylon</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BTC timestamping protocol is particularly useful in improving the integrity and security of PoS networks and preventing long-range attacks, which occur when a malicious validator attempts to take over a blockchain with a forked false chain. With BTC timestamps, the attacking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-fork-in-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">fork</a> will have a later BTC timestamp, which will never be chosen by anyone in a fork choice. Meanwhile, it serves as the building block of the staking protocol by establishing synchronization between Bitcoin and the PoS blockchains. This also removes the need for social consensus, as Bitcoin timestamps are objective.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, the timestamping protocol facilitates cross-chain security, fast stake unbonding, reduced cost of security, composable trust, and the bootstrapping of new chains. It achieves this by combining the short-range security of Proof-of-Stake chains with the long-range security of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/proof-of-work-pow\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Work</a> Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Bitcoin data availability protocol utilizes Bitcoin’s limited block space for vital tasks, such as providing a censorship-resistant layer for PoS chains. Bitcoin’s blockspace, known for its unparalleled security and censorship resistance, has proven to be essential in protecting the decentralized ecosystem. The data availability protocol ensures that critical data is always obtainable and secure, further enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of PoS chains.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Problems Tackled by Babylon</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using its various mechanisms, Babylon offers various solutions to challenges affecting the broader blockchain ecosystem. Some of these include;</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Establishing Protocol Security for New Chains</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New blockchain platforms tend to struggle with security issues, especially in the short period following their launch. These networks are more vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/crypto-hacks-exploits-by-year\" target=\"_blank\">exploits</a> and often require a robust security infrastructure to maintain their integrity in the beginning.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Babylon, newly-launched blockchains can leverage Bitcoin's security, improving their overall stability and reliability. For instance, Babylon’s timestamping protocol can help to secure the new blockchain networks against long-range attacks by utilizing Bitcoin’s timestamps. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Increased Capital Efficiency for Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Babylon improves capital efficiency in the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling BTC holders to stake their coins on PoS chains through the staking protocol. As already mentioned, the staking protocol removes the need for Bitcoin to be bridged, wrapped, or held by third parties, thereby maintaining liquidity. Ultimately, this broadens the use cases of Bitcoin in the ecosystem, from the security of PoS networks to earning incentives on staked BTC.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fast Unbonding</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On many staking protocols, the process of unstaking assets can be time-consuming. This can reduce the flexibility for participants, thereby discouraging them from parting with their assets. However, Babylon’s approach of using Bitcoin timestamping for synchronization between Bitcoin and PoS chains ensures that the unstaking process is fast and users can access their funds as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Partnerships and Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As earlier mentioned, Babylon has established a robust ecosystem through strategic partnerships with various prominent projects in the blockchain space. These partnerships are not only focused on the technology; they are also about a shared vision for a more secure and efficient decentralized future. Below are some of Babylon’s key partners and ecosystem components.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lombard</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of Babylon’s most significant partnerships is with Lombard, a startup also focused on integrating Bitcoin into the DeFi ecosystem. With participation from Babylon, Lombard has raised $16 million in order to explore the uncharted territory of Bitcoin restaking.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Lombard is excited to announce our $16M seed round to kick-start the Bitcoin restaking ecosystem led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/polychain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@polychain</a>!<br>\n<br>\nWith additional participation from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/babylon_chain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@babylon_chain</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daofive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@daofive</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTI_Global?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FTI_Global</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForesightVen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ForesightVen</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mirana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mirana</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xMantleEco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@0xMantleEco</a> Fund, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NomadCapital_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NomadCapital_io</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKX_Ventures?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OKX_Ventures</a>, and… <a href=\"https://t.co/QOlsrlQcz5\">pic.twitter.com/QOlsrlQcz5</a></p>\n— Lombard (@Lombard_Finance) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lombard_Finance/status/1808155649940791689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 2, 2024</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the concept of restaking was first introduced on Ethereum through <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/eigenlayer-restaking-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">EigenLayer</a>, a protocol that enables participants to restake their staked assets to secure other Ethereum applications and earn additional rewards.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Babylon collaboration will leverage Lombard’s introduction of “liquid Bitcoin” (LBTC) tokens. This LBTC token refers to a tradeable receipt for Babylon deposits that will allow users to retain liquidity over their staked BTC.</p>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Liquid Bitcoin on Lombard\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10918/content_Screen_Shot_2024-07-24_at_03.50.44.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 676px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://lombard.finance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lombard</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, LBTC can be moved freely across different blockchains, providing users with flexibility and accessibility. This cross-chain capability ensures that Bitcoin holders can take advantage of DeFi opportunities across multiple platforms. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lombard’s partnership with Babylon is part of a broader strategy to connect PoS chains with Bitcoin-backed security, offering endless DeFi opportunities to Bitcoin holders. This integration not only benefits users but also enhances the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> and security of the entire ecosystem. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Akash Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/akash-network\" target=\"_blank\">Akash Network</a> is a decentralized cloud infrastructure that gives users control over pricing and amenities while benefiting from efficient transactions and minimal environmental impact. The network's partnership with Babylon helps boost its security by integrating Bitcoin’s robust features into its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These security measures enable Akash to create a more secure and cost-effective way for users to record transactions and deploy workloads. The collaboration with Babylon strengthens Akash's market position by significantly enhancing security and efficiency.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Akash network\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10919/content_Screen_Shot_2024-07-24_at_03.55.03.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 676px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://akash.network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Akash</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, this partnership grants Akash Network access to Bitcoin's reliable timestamping service and source of trust. This integration prevents double-spend attacks and allows for fast stake unbonding, providing users with greater flexibility and confidence in the security of their assets. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, by leveraging Babylon’s technology, Akash can offer improved scalability, accommodating the growing demands of its user base. With advanced security measures, Akash Network aims to deliver a secure and cost-effective decentralized cloud solution, continuously pushing the boundaries in decentralized cloud computing.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cosmos Hub</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos Hub</a> is a network of independent parallel chains designed with the Cosmos software development kit (SDK). Through the Bitcoin staking protocol, Cosmos’ partnership with Babylon allows BTC holders to stake their coins to secure the Hub’s consumer chains and earn additional rewards.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Cosmos Babylon crypto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10920/content_Screen_Shot_2024-08-07_at_23.18.31.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 679px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos</a></span></div>\n\n<p>Cosmos’ blockchain ecosystem leverages Babylon’s Comet extension to enhance security aggregation to the Cosmos Hub blockchain and all consumer chains. In simpler terms, the integration of Babylon’s technology to the hubs prevents unpleasant scenarios, such as double signing.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bitcoin Layer 2s</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although Bitcoin is arguably the most secure network in the crypto space, it still has some limitations, especially when it comes to smart contract functionality and support of other digital assets. This gap has spurred the development of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-layer-2s-top-bitcoin-layer-2s?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions </a>designed to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, these L2s often depend on third-party custodians or multi-sig bridges to facilitate their operations, which contradicts Bitcoin's decentralized ethos. Ultimately, this dependency can raise concerns about security and control, as users might find it difficult to trust these intermediaries to properly manage and secure their assets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fortunately, Babylon’s BTC staking protocol addresses these challenges by allowing users to stake their BTC directly. This enhances the security of PoS networks without the need for third-party custody or wrapping. This seamless integration benefits both the Bitcoin ecosystem and PoS networks. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some Layer 2 projects have started utilizing Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol, including Lorenzo and Bison. Lorenzo, for example, is a BTC L2 infrastructure that focuses on yield-bearing token issuance, trading, and settlement. By leveraging Babylon’s staking protocol, Lorenzo enables native <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimistic-vs-zero-knowledge-rollups?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">rollups</a> to integrate native BTC assets and stake BTC for yield. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, Bison Network is a ZK-STARK rollup on Bitcoin that offers general programmability, allowing developers to design decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other DeFi tools. Bison basically provides Bitcoin-native smart contract functionalities, while using Babylon’s infrastructure to enhance its transaction efficiency and overall security. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Babylon taps from Bitcoin’s security architecture to secure Proof-of-Stake blockchains while allowing BTC holders to earn yields safely. Its innovative staking protocol ensures strong security for PoS chains while giving users liquidity and control. This project spotlights the fact that Bitcoin is not only a store of value but can also be a trusted security backbone for other blockchains. With strategic partnerships like Lombard and Akash Network, Babylon continues to strengthen its ecosystem and expand its role within the decentralized finance industry.</p>"

        "content": {
          "_type": "html",
          "__text": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Understanding Concentrated Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concentrated Liquidity pools are liquidity pools on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange-dex\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized exchanges </a>(DEX) in which you have to allocate liquidity in a custom price range. You will have full control over the price range and you can adjust it anytime at will. Concentrated Liquidity pools are more capital efficient than traditional <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi\" target=\"_blank\">“XYK” liquidity pools</a> and have the potential to generate greater yields.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Concentrated Liquidity involves providing liquidity in a defined price range and requires active monitoring.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Concentrated Liquidity pools have the potential to provide extremely high returns.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Users have to be cautious of incurring too many fees when adjusting price ranges.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Cover Page\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10988/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Cover_Page.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Is This a Concentrated Liquidity Pool?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’ve encountered terms like \"Liquidity/Price Range\", \"Liquidity Shape” or “Trading Bins” it’s likely that you’re working with a Concentrated Liquidity pool. If those terms seems confusing to you, here’s a visual representation of what a Concentrated Liquidity pool might look like on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/potential-ambient-airdrop-earn-ambient-points\" target=\"_blank\">Ambient Finance</a>:</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Example\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10989/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Example.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 423px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When providing <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> in the example above for the ETH/USDC pair within a 10% range, your liquidity will only be active and generate trading fees if the market price of Ether falls between $2,304.03 and $2,815.25. In other words, if the market price of Ether moves more than 10% in either direction (up or down), your liquidity now becomes out of range and will cease to accrue fees.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Use Concentrated Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The concept of Concentrated Liquidity was first introduced by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/uniswap-vs-trader-joe?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Uniswap V3</a> in March 2021 to tackle the capital inefficiencies inherent in traditional XYK liquidity pools. In those traditional pools, liquidity was spread uniformly across the entire price range from $0 to ∞. While this approach guaranteed liquidity at every price level regardless of market volatility, most of this liquidity went unused. With Concentrated Liquidity, liquidity providers can now focus their capital within narrower price ranges, enhancing capital efficiency and ultimately boosting their yields.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concentrated Liquidity offers liquidity providers a high degree of flexibility and control over how they choose to allocate their capital. In doing so, they can sometimes experience very lucrative yields; however, they are highly variable because the yield depends on their choice of price ranges.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, on Ambient Finance, Concentrated Liquidity yields varies based on the price ranges chosen by each liquidity provider:</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Yield Example\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10990/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Yield_Example.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 218px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, taking a look at the classic example of XYK-pools on Syncswap, all liquidity providers receive 8.94% yields.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Yield Example 2 (XYK)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10991/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Yield_Example_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 768px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notice in the above examples, Concentrated Liquidity yields vary from 0.18% to 284.19%. This is because each liquidity position generates its own set of yield. Yield is no longer shared in a communal pool like in Syncswap’s XYK pools whereby all liquidity providers experience the same yield, 8.94%.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Cons of Concentrated Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While lucrative, Concentrated Liquidity positions require more effort to upkeep and there are multiple pitfalls that you have to watch out for.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Increased Oversight</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned above, whenever your Concentrated Liquidity goes out of range, you will no longer be accruing fees. This means that Concentrated Liquidity positions require active monitoring as compared to the more passive XYK liquidity pools.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s an example of what kind of oversight may be needed.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Cons Example\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10992/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Cons_Example.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 448px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the above example, the TIA/ETH liquidity position on Trader Joe is out of range. In order to fix this, you would have to first, remove your liquidity position, update your preferred liquidity provision range to current market prices and then redeposit the liquidity.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you don’t adjust your liquidity position when it goes out of range, you won’t generate any yield. However, be cautious, as frequently updating the price ranges of your Concentrated Liquidity positions can be expensive. Balancing between the safety of a broader price range and the higher yields from a narrower range is often a complex choice.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Potentially Higher Impermanent Loss</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Concentrated Liquidity positions, whenever your position goes out of range, your liquidity becomes entirely denominated in one asset. For instance, in the example above, a previous 50/50 split of TIA/ETH has shifted entirely to ETH due to TIA’s relative price increase compared to ETH at the time of writing.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This differs from XYK pools, where your liquidity remains partially in both assets due to the infinite price range. As a result, impermanent loss can be more pronounced in Concentrated Liquidity pools compared to XYK pools.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Are Trading Bins?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The introduction of Concentrated Liquidity leads to the creation of the now widely used term “Trading Bins”. Concentrated Liquidity divides the previously continuous spectrum of price space into discrete segments, with Trading Bins representing the nominal boundaries for liquidity positions. While some DEXs simplify this by using straightforward price ranges such as in Ambient Finance, you might still come across the term Trading Bins in certain platforms.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Meteora, you have many bin step options for any liquidity position: </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Trading Bins\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10993/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Trading_Bins.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 547px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Essentially, a larger bin step corresponds to a wider price range, whereas a smaller bin step indicates a narrower price range. The specific calculations for bin steps can vary depending on the platform.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Are Liquidity Shapes?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to Concentrated Liquidity, some DEXs, like Trader Joe, offer you the ability to choose your liquidity distribution shape, where you can allocate different amounts of tokens at diverse price points. There are various reasons for you to choose other options but in general, a uniformly distributed shape, “Spot” in this case would suit the purposes of most liquidity providers. Read <a href=\"https://support.traderjoexyz.com/en/articles/6707938-an-introduction-to-liquidity-shapes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn more about the niche cases of other liquidity shapes.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Shapes\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10994/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Shapes.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 505px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why Is Shifting Price Ranges Costly?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shifting price ranges can be costly due to the accumulation of transaction and swap fees. When your position goes out of range, it becomes entirely denominated in one asset. If you then want to rebalance your position to a 50/50 asset split, you'll need to swap half of your assets before redepositing them.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s a typical process:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Remove TIA/ETH liquidity</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Swap half of the ETH to TIA</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Redeploy the liquidity</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the swap fees incurred in step 2, you may also face price <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/slippage-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">slippage</a> during steps 1 and 3, which can further increase your costs. Therefore, it’s advisable to avoid frequently shifting price ranges.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Often Should I Adjust Price Ranges?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is largely dependent on your belief of current market prices, if you believe that prices will soon revert to previous levels. You might choose not to adjust your price range, as your position could return to being within range once prices drop.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another consideration is the current yields of your liquidity position. If the yield you are able to obtain in the time before your position goes out of range is expected to be higher than the costs you incur while shifting price ranges, it may be worth it to adjust price ranges. Ultimately, some trial and error is expected here.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concentrated Liquidity has become the preferred method for liquidity pools on many popular DEXs, including Uniswap, Ambient Finance, Thruster Finance, and others. Although it can be cumbersome, the focus on capital efficiency represents a significant advancement in DeFi, positioning it as the likely future direction for the space.</p>"

The Role Playing game (RPG) industry is expected to reach <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/app/games/role-playing-games/worldwide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a valuation of over $70 billion by 2027</a> while the MMORPG global market is currently valued at <a href=\"https://www.industryresearch.biz/global-mmorpg-gaming-market-25112920\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">over $20 billion</a> with millions of players worldwide engaging in such games.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, just like regular games, MMORPGs suffer from a lack of tangible rewards and a lack of player ownership. According to Zentry, “valuable data and revenue are harvested by corporations, leaving the true creators of this wealth — the gamers — without the reward they deserve”.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://zentry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zentry</a> is introducing advanced gaming infrastructure that bridges Web2 and Web3 across identity, asset, and activity, leveraging the blockchain to usher gamers into a new world that puts them first. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Introducing Zentry</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zentry aims to bring the MMORPG experience to real life through a unified Play Economy that takes place across the digital and physical worlds. On Zentry, players can create an avatar that gradually evolves in status, uniqueness, and wealth through play across various ecosystems. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zentry’s universe consists of multiple products, each with its own unique narrative and world, although they are connected by shared lore. At time of writing, the Zentry universe consists of:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nexus</strong>: The metagame gateway for Web3, adding a gamification layer on top of social interactions (now available for X/Twitter). </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Radiant</strong>: Radiant is Zentry’s cross-platform app that turns Web2 and Web3 gaming activities into a rewarding adventure.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> <strong>Azul</strong>: An AI-powered gaming companion for Zentry that improves the productivity of gamers. According to the project, Azul adds more fun and makes online gamers more productive.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Zigma</strong>: Zigma is an upcoming NFT collection by Zentry inspired by anime and online gaming.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this isn’t just limited to games; for example, players could earn rewards for in-game achievements, but they can also earn rewards for real world activities like buying coffee from a partner store. These rewards can be in-game items on Zentry, which could be in turn exchanged for tokens, real-world rewards, or even NFTs with additional capabilities. Because of Zentry’s flexibility, it transcends the limitations of a traditional game, while offering an inclusive space where anyone – from casual gamers to speculators, collectors to token holders – can take part in the adventure. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">History of Zentry</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before evolving into Zentry, the project was known as GuildFi, which was an interconnected ecosystem of Web3 games, guild communities, and NFTs that combined DeFi initiatives like financial incentives and rewards with GameFi. To better enable players to discover new games and guilds, GuildFi offered players a Guild Discovery feature that lets players discover curated games.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In its new form as Zentry, it has a new vision, new narrative, and a new token to power its universe. Zentry has a treasury of over $100 million in non-native assets, raised from top-tier VCs like Binance Labs, Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Brands, Hashed, and more. According to Jarindr Thitadilaka, co-founder and CEO of Zentry:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Think of the Zentry as a new layer, which does the computing, gamifying, bridging, connecting and rewarding for everything that happens in other layers, permeating through various applications, platforms, and virtual worlds.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Metagame Layer</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine going on coffee runs with your friends and getting rewarded for it. This is what Zentry hopes to offer to its players with the Metagame Layer that brings the MMORPG experience to real life. The Metagame Layer integrates player identities, activities from several games and other consumer apps, along with a reward system into a single platform, allowing gamers to ‘live their real life in a virtual world’ and earn rewards.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Metagame Layer is a synergy of</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Blockchain technology</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Selected consumer applications and</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A multiversal IP world.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using the blockchain, Zentry’s Metagame Layer creates a connection between Web2 and Web3 worlds, allowing users to bridge their data to the distributed ledger, where users can own, create and manage their assets and activities on this layer. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zentry incorporates a story-driven and evolving product ecosystem into the metagame layer in an attempt to transform the lives of gamers. With the Metagame Layer, Zentry enables users to create a dynamic avatar profile that they truly own, where each player’s profile develops based on their engagement with activities on the platform.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the project, this arrangement ushers billions of MMORPG gamers into a unified Play Economy across digital and physical realms. Zentry embraces different factions of participants including gamers, investors, and NFT collectors. Each of these factions can engage in related activities and applications on the platform, contribute to the project’s growth, and earn rewards for their actions. The game’s economy is powered by the ZENT token.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is ZENT?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On April 25, 2024, Zentry migrated from the GuildFi (GF) token to the ZENT token in a 1:10 conversion ratio. The migration is meant to widen the project’s scope and improve the community’s experience. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zentry\" target=\"_blank\">ZENT</a> is the native token of the Zentry ecosystem, playing a central role in the project’s economy and governance. ZENT holders can benefit from extra income from Zentry’s shared value program, and will also play an active role in deciding changes to the project by taking part in the ZENTRY DAO. ZENT is also used to incentivize platform users through airdrops and other promotional events.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The total supply of ZENT tokens is 10 billion, about 40% of these tokens are currently in circulation. 14% of the total supply is allocated to the project’s treasury, 40% is reserved for ecosystem development and 15% is allocated to the team. 24% of the total supply will be used for fundraisers.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Migration From GuildFi to ZENT</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the old GuildFi (GF) token are expected to complete their migration process on or before August 25, 2024 – the set deadline for migration. GF tokens held on exchanges will be automatically migrated to ZENT before this period. The conversion ratio is 1:10, that is GF holders get 10 ZENT tokens for each GF token held.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visit the <a href=\"http://guildfi.com/migration\" target=\"_blank\">migration portal</a> to convert your tokens</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/zentry/zentry-token-migration-47edb54bc5a9\" target=\"_blank\">guide for the migration procedure</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Nexus: Zentry’s Social Gateway</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creating a connection between Web2 data and Web3 is one of the major goals of Zentry. Nexus is the fourth flagship product and one that builds on the routine social activities of the users. Nexus is a social game where users interact with friends, perform usual activities on social media, and get rewarded according to Zentry’s economics. Each eligible activity is rewarded with Nexus SHARDS.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users are required to connect their social profile on X (formerly Twitter) to Nexus. On the user’s approval, Zentry uses its multiversal API to connect to the social account track the user’s data in real-time and translate them to useful information for the platform’s operations. Users earn for interacting with posts from their friends, followers, and social media influencers. Each activity is weighted and rewards are distributed accordingly. Do note that content quality is more important than content quantity!</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Nexus Zentry's Social Gateway\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10885/content_Nexus_Zentry_Social_Gateway.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 653px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zentry is building a base for multiplayer online games, while bringing together Web2 and Web3 gaming experiences. With the launch of Nexus, one of its four flagship products, players stand a chance of transforming their social time into an MMORPG experience where they can engage with their friends while earning rewards as part of the game experience. As the project continues to develop, we could see even more utilities develop from the platform.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having said this, it is important to understand the provisions of the project. Zentry intends to build a home for games and gamers, using the blockchain as a connectivity infrastructure. In the course of this article, we attempted to explain the basic ideas behind the project, but this might not be exhaustive of everything the project offers. As an emerging project, keep in mind that the platform could be prone to significant changes. Also, note that this article only reviews Zentry for educational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.</p>"

With its impressive speed, security and scalability, GalaChain is the backbone of Gala’s core family of brands, with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-gala-music\" target=\"_blank\">Gala Music</a> and Gala Film built on the network. This blockchain ensures that various components of the Gala ecosystem operate smoothly without the delays and high costs associated with other blockchains.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"GalaChain\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10966/content_GalaChain.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At its core, GalaChain is powered by a network of Founder’s Nodes. The central token, GALA, plays a crucial role, being burned as transactional gas fees and rewarding the node operators that power the ecosystem. As a Layer 1 blockchain, GalaChain also enables the creation of other tokens, channels and more specialized node networks, such as its game-specific nodes for titles like Common Ground World and Last Expedition, or its Theater Nodes, which host decentralized film content on the Gala Film platform.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain was designed with a clear objective: To robustly support the demands of Web2 gaming while adding Web3 functions (such as ownership and rewards) and extending its capabilities to other industries. The design philosophy behind GalaChain is simple yet ambitious: If it can seamlessly handle the intensive requirements of gaming, it can accommodate virtually any application or industry need. This approach positions GalaChain as a distinctly scalable blockchain solution with a head start on the tech demands of multiple industries.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Footprint Analytics GalaChain Dashboard\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10967/content_Footprint_Analytics_GalaChain_Dashboard.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 636px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Team Behind GalaChain</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gala was founded in 2018 by Eric Schiermeyer, co-founder of Zynga and pioneering innovator of the social gaming genre. The founding team included some of the creators of social gaming hits like Farmville 2, Words with Friends and Zynga Poker. Zynga is recognized as a global leader in interactive entertainment, known for its social video game services. Farmville 2 is one of its standout agriculture-simulation social network games whose legacy is carried on with Gala’s Common Ground World, adding ownership, rewards and unique farm sim mechanics to a massively popular gaming genre.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gala’s partnerships span a diverse array of reputable entities within the gaming and entertainment industries. These include DreamWorks Animation, an animation studio under Universal Pictures; AMC Networks, an entertainment company; and NBCUniversal, a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate. Additionally, Gala has collaborated with iconic game developers such as Peter Molyneux and Will Wright. The company also works with music industry giants such as Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Brray, Kings of Leon and many more.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its inception, Gala has grown to be a leader in Web3 entertainment. The development of GalaChain exemplifies its commitment to innovation, providing a robust and versatile blockchain platform to support its expanding ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How GalaChain Works</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain combines advanced blockchain technology with a robust network infrastructure to create a versatile and high-performance platform for the Gala ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hyperledger Fabric (HLF)</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain is built on the robust foundation of Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), which provides a modular architecture with interchangeable components such as consensus and membership services. This plug-and-play environment ensures that GalaChain can be customized to meet the specific needs of the Gala ecosystem. Hyperledger Fabric, a project initiated by the Linux Foundation in 2015, promotes the development of cross-industry blockchain technologies through a collaborative, community-driven approach.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the key features of Hyperledger Fabric is its private and permissioned nature, making it ideal for enterprise use. Companies like Honeywell, Walmart, and Bosch leverage HLF for their secure, scalable, and customizable private blockchains. For GalaChain, this means a stable and adaptable chain that supports the various components of Gala’s entertainment ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain sets itself apart from other blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin which rely on non-permissioned, probabilistic consensus algorithms and are prone to ledger forks. GalaChain uses deterministic consensus algorithms with a specific type of node called an orderer, part of an ordering service. This asynchronous and multi-step process ensures that any block validated by a peer is final and accurate, eliminating the risk of ledger forks. By separating chaincode execution from the ordering process, GalaChain avoids bottlenecks, enhancing performance and scalability. The blockchain is designed to integrate smoothly with both Gala’s platform and the Gala Node Network.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Founder’s Nodes</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Founder’s Node Ecosystem is another cornerstone of GalaChain’s architecture. Limited to just 50,000 nodes, these operators are crucial in providing players with true ownership of their assets and content. By running a Founder’s Node, operators help maintain a decentralized infrastructure that supports complex, decentralized tasks tailored to specific project needs. Daily distribution from these Founder’s Nodes are the only way GALA originates.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alongside Founder’s Nodes, many projects throughout the Gala Ecosystem are running individual Nodes with specialized workloads.The Gala Node Network supports custom-built tasks and provides a unique approach to project monetization, bypassing the complexities of traditional ICOs and reducing central costs. Their effectiveness is proven, serving as the backbone for existing applications and top-tier games.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developed by experts who have built some of the largest gaming networks globally, these nodes offer unparalleled experience and scalability. This allows projects to expand their node network as needed, potentially eliminating the need for datacenter and cloud hosting expenses.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The scope of Founder’s Nodes operations is set to expand significantly in the near future. They are expected to take on critical responsibilities in bridge transactions and chain security, among other key functions. Their versatility and capacity to adapt to various roles ensure the robustness and agility of the ecosystem, making it well-equipped to meet both current and future challenges.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Features of GalaChain</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The following features make GalaChain a sustainable and accessible platform for developers and users alike, supporting a wide range of applications within the Gala ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Environmentally Conscious</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain is designed to be environmentally conscious, consuming significantly less energy than other blockchain platforms while offering superior computational capabilities.

FILM will serve as the utility token within the Gala Film ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">NFTs</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The GalaChain ecosystem includes a variety of popular NFT collections encompassing in-game NFTs from Gala Games, music NFTs from Gala Music, and film NFTs from Gala Film. These NFTs provide unique digital assets that enhance user engagement and offer new monetization opportunities for creators. NFT enthusiasts can mint and transfer their NFTs on the GalaChain Inventory or through third-party marketplaces such as NFTHarbor.io.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"GalaChain NFT\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10971/content_GalaChain_NFT.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 701px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.footprint.network/research/chain/chain-stats/gala-chain-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Footprint Analytics GalaChain NFT Dashboard</a></span></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeFi</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaSwap enables direct token swapping on GalaChain, allowing users to trade GALA and other bridgeable tokens seamlessly. The GalaSwap Project Token Creation Tool allows the creation of custom tokens on GalaChain, also allowing creators to distribute mint allowances as they wish to addresses on chain.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The GALA Token</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala\" target=\"_blank\">GALA</a> serves as the foundational utility token within the expansive Gala ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">GALA</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GALA is aimed at facilitating a seamless, secure mode of payment and incentivization among participants engaging within the network.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GALA acts as the primary reward mechanism for Founder’s Nodes, accruing GALA daily according to benchmarks based on uptime to support the network workloads.. Founder’s Nodes also receive distributions of other tokens in the ecosystem, as well as a small percentage of NFTs minted to GalaChain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The token employs a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-gnosis-safe?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Gnosis multisig safe</a>, a secure arrangement ensuring that no single team member has unilateral access. This reinforces the principle of collective oversight and enhancing operational security.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The total supply of GALA is capped at 50 billion tokens. The daily emission rate is dynamically adjusted based on the circulating supply. This supply decreases when GALA is burned after being used as fees within the Gala ecosystem or spent on activities that support the ecosystem. GALA was launched without any pre-minting or initial allocation. All tokens were earned through Founder’s Node operation, with 100% of GALA allocated to Founder’s Nodes within the Gala ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain Allowance</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain Allowance is a system that grants rewards from running a node or other various reward mechanisms, allowing users to convert these rewards into on-chain tokens within their wallets at their convenience. Once a GalaChain Allowance is granted, users can choose to convert or fulfill the allowance, transferring the tokens to their GalaChain wallet.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This system ensures that the rewards or tokens are reserved for the user until they are ready to mint them, providing a flexible and cost-free method for managing rewards and in-game assets. It is an evolution of the previous Treasure Chest system Gala used prior to the debut of GalaChain, when tokens were minted on Ethereum. It allows users to have control over any costs or tax implications of minting.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Next for GalaChain?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"https://news.gala.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Gala-Ecosystem-Blueprint.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gala Ecosystem Blueprint</a>, GalaChain’s roadmap for Q3 2024 includes several key developments aimed at enhancing its ecosystem. The upcoming Node Workload Development SDK will enable the creation of game-specific and activity-specific nodes, while the Chaincode Template Bounty Program will encourage innovation among community developers.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain plans to create more open-source options around utilizing its platform to go along with the GalaChain SDK developers are already using to spin up their own channels and deploy their own chain code to GalaChain. Furthermore, SDKs for Android and iOS will be developed to expand mobile development within the Gala ecosystem, along with an SDK for Unreal Engine to support advanced game development.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking ahead to Q4 2024 and beyond, GalaChain aims to build bridges to other prominent blockchain ecosystems, enhancing interoperability and the utility of the Gala Ecosystem. Plans are also in place for developers to have the opportunity to deploy Isochains on Founder’s Nodes, selecting the number of nodes needed to achieve desired resiliency levels. This will incentivize and reward node operators, ensuring their continued contribution to the network.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain stands as the cornerstone infrastructure for the Gala ecosystem, blending advanced blockchain technology with a robust network of nodes. Influential in Web3 gaming development, GalaChain plays a crucial role in the gaming industry innovation. With its innovative features, developer-friendly tools, and decentralized structure, GalaChain not only supports the diverse needs of the Gala ecosystem but also sets the stage for future advancements.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: Stella L (<a href=\"mailto:stella@footprint.network\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">stella@footprint.network</a>)</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About Footprint Analytics</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Footprint Analytics is a comprehensive blockchain data analytics platform that simplifies complex analysis for businesses and projects in the Web3 ecosystem.

The platform aims to enable sovereign game economies that can roll up and settle on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a> network. It is powered by the HyperGrid framework, a core technology developed by Mirror World that enhances customizability and scalability while remaining compatible with Solana’s Layer 1 services. This allows developers to deploy custom Sonic SVM chains  and offers scaling advantages. Sonic itself is able to process millions of requests per second for games to create a high-performance environment for both developers and players. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than that, the platform also supports atomic interoperability to facilitate secure and efficient exchanges across multiple networks. This enables transactions on Sonic without needing to redeploy existing Solana programs and accounts. As a result, this feature lets developers leverage Solana’s Layer 1 services and liquidity directly. On top of that, Sonic is designed to offer fast transaction speeds with low costs in order to become one of the fastest on-chain gaming experiences available and can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second on its grids.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sonic is also <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) compatible, allowing developers to write applications for EVM and execute them on Sonic’s SVM. As such, the platform is able to facilitate the seamless deployment of decentralized applications from EVM chains to Solana. Sonic has built-in mechanisms that help developers build and execute game development on Solana such as a sandbox environment, customizable gaming primitives, and extensible data types. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team behind Sonic is Mirror World Labs, an organization building out Solana’s Web3 gaming infrastructure. Chris Zhu, CEO of MirrorWorld said, “We see Sonic’s modular SVM will be the key to unlocking the Solana gaming summer, onboarding thousands of games to launch and go to market with our support.” </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sonic recently raised $12 million in a Series A funding round led by BITKRAFT which received participation from Galaxy Interactive, Big Brain Holdings, and others. This funding is aimed at accelerating the development of the Sonic protocol and improving the gaming infrastructure on Solana.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users can now participate in the Sonic testnet phase, called Odyssey, to interact with the platform and experience the available gameplay. With the Sonic mainnet expected to go live soon, now is a good time to get familiar with Sonic!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do note that at the time of writing, the Sonic team has not made any official announcements on a future token launch or airdrop event. Therefore, following the steps below and participating in the Sonic Odyssey testnet phase does not guarantee a token airdrop allocation.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Connect Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, head to <a href=\"https://odyssey.sonic.game/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://odyssey.sonic.game/</a> and <strong>Connect Wallet</strong> in the upper right corner. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Connect Wallet to Sonic\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10921/content_1._Connect_wallet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 621px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the time of writing, the Backpack and Nightly wallets are the only options that support Sonic. You will  need to use one of these in order to complete tasks and claim rewards.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this guide, we are using the Backpack wallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Choose and connect Backpack wallet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10922/content_1.1_choose.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 621px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Request Sol Test Token</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before requesting Sol test tokens, you need to add the Sonic Devnet to your wallet. In your Backpack wallet, go to <strong>Settings</strong> which is found under Account.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Request Sol Test Tokens\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10924/content_2.1_settings.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1024px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Click on <strong>Preferences</strong> and turn on <strong>Developer Mode</strong>.</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"Turn on developer mode\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10925/content_2.2_Dev_mode.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1024px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then back in your wallet, <strong>Add Network</strong> under your wallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Add network\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10926/content_2.3_add_network.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1024px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Type in <strong>Sonic Devnet</strong> and choose to enable it.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Sonic Devnet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10927/content_2.4_sonic.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1024px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that you have the Sonic Devnet in your wallet, go to <a href=\"https://faucet.sonic.game/#/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://faucet.sonic.game/#/</a> and paste your wallet address in the space. <strong>Confirm Airdrop</strong> to receive your Sol test tokens.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Confirm airdrop\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10928/content_2._request.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 621px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Complete Tasks</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a few tasks you can complete to earn Ring Mystery Boxes. The first is to <strong>Meet Sonic</strong> and follow the protocol’s social media. Click <strong>Meet Sonic</strong> to be directed to the task page.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Meet Sonic Socials\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10929/content_3._Sonic_socials.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 621px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Click on <strong>Follow on X</strong> and authorize the app to access your account. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then <strong>Join Discord</strong> which will open up your app and add you to Sonic’s Discord server.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Sonic Social Media Tasks\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10930/content_3.1_tasks.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 602px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, head over to the <strong>Check In</strong> task page where you can perform the daily check-in. The rewards for checking in is broken down as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check in for 1 - 7 days: 1x Ring Mystery Box</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check in for 8 - 14 days: 2x Ring Mystery Boxes</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check in for more than 14 days: 3x Ring Mystery Boxes</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Therefore, checking in daily will help you earn more ring mystery boxes.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Check-in Rewards\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10931/content_4._check_in.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 602px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the <strong>Referral</strong> page, you will find your invite code to share with others. Each successful invitee who completes the Meet Sonic task will reward you with a ring mystery box.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Invite code for Sonic\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10932/content_5._Referral.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 602px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lastly, you can head over to <strong>Game Adventure</strong> to explore the different games available. Sonic plans to keep adding more so be sure to check this page often for any new games. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the time of writing, there are three available games which are SnakeLite, FoMoney meets 2048, and JogoJogo.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SnakeLite is a Telegram-based <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-tap-2-earn-crypto-top-tap-to-earn-games?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Tap-to-Earn</a> GameFi built on TON while FoMoney provides on-chain gameplay that merges the classic 2048 mechanics with the incentive system pioneered by Fomo3D. Meanwhile, JogoJogo is a social entertainment platform that allows for predictions, gaming, and battles.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"GameFi on Sonic\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10933/content_6._games.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 757px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 4: Collect Rings</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the top right corner, next to the bell icon, you can check your ring mystery boxes and rings. Click <strong>Open Mystery Box</strong> to get your rings.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Open Mystery Box\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10934/content_7._Mystery_box.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 663px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Choose how many boxes you want to <strong>Open</strong> and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Open mystery box\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10935/content_7.1_open_box.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 663px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will then receive rings that are automatically added to your profile. Performing more tasks and inviting others will earn you more ring mystery boxes.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Open ring\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10936/content_7.2_rings.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 663px;\"></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sonic SVM is the first Layer 2 solution specifically designed for enhancing the growth of gaming applications on the Solana blockchain. It was launched by the Mirror World team and is built on the HyperGrid framework to allow for high scalability and performance. The platform is currently running its testnet phase, allowing users to interact and become familiar with its features.</p>"
