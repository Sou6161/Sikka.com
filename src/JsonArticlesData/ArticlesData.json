By voting \"yes\" or \"no\" to future events, the prediction market determines a price that represents the market's estimate of the probability of the event occurring.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prediction markets are generally divided into two main categories: sports and non-sports. The non-sports category, which drives the most volume, encompasses a range of topics including predictions on crypto, politics, and cultural events.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Users bet on future event outcomes using cryptocurrency, buying shares that pay out based on accuracy. Market prices aggregate beliefs into a sentiment barometer.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Polymarket is the largest prediction market, using USDC stablecoin. Others include, Polymarket, Polkamarkets, Hedgehog Markets, Drift, Limitless, Swaye, Inertia, Zeitgeist, Azuro, Monaco, SX Network, Overtime,  and Manifold Markets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">These markets incentivize sharing true beliefs through financial commitment. High participation integrates varied views into market-determined probability forecasts.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What are crypto prediction markets?\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9170/content_Crypto_Prediction_Markets.webp\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 475px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When can we say we really know what’s going to happen in the future? And if we think we know, are we willing to put those beliefs to the test? Now with prediction markets in crypto, we can. In this article we’ll take a look at prediction markets in crypto, explain the most popular ones, and how we can get started using them.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Predicting the future with crypto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9142/content_image5.webp\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Image generated by writer using DALL·E 3 </span></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Prediction Markets In Crypto Explained</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prediction markets in crypto allow you to bet on the outcomes of future events. Topics to take a stance on can range drastically and will often follow the 'current' thing, ranging from climate change to political elections or even supernatural events.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>For example, the prediction market that was resolved around the Bitcoin approval date – 'Bitcoin ETF approved by Jan 15?'</em></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>People who thought it would be approved before January 15, 2024, bought themselves \"Yes\" shares for $0.50 meaning they thought there was a 50% chance it would. People who thought this was too early bought a “No” share.</em></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>But as we got closer to the date and more bullish signals and news were publicized, more people were convinced the ETF would be approved before the set date. So we saw a rise in price of ‘Yes’ shares and a decline of “No” shares.</em></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>With the ETF ultimately being approved on January 11, 2024, the market resolved earlier than expected and anyone who bet on \"Yes\" and held their shares saw each of their shares become worth $1 immediately. Conversely, any trader who owned \"No\" shares saw their investment become worthless.</em></p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Mechanisms Defining Prediction Markets</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two primary mechanisms in prediction markets: sometimes referred to as ‘Web2.5’ and ‘Web3’. Web2.5 platforms use cryptocurrency primarily as a payment method, with the backend processes similar to traditional betting platforms.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Web3 prediction markets, on the other hand, leverage aspects of blockchain for enhanced transparency and execution. They utilize smart contracts for bet execution and mechanisms like automated market makers (AMMs) and order books, known from and served on permissionless decentralized finance exchanges.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oracles also play a crucial role in prediction markets by providing reliable and impartial data needed to resolve market outcomes. In the context of Polymarket, the <a href=\"https://uma.xyz/#how-it-works\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UMA</a> oracle acts as an arbitrator for market outcomes. The process begins when a market is created on Polymarket using the Gnosis conditional token framework. The market's resolution is dependent on a specific condition that needs to be verified by an oracle.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Are the Pay-Outs Mechanisms on Crypto Prediction Markets?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two different methods for getting paid out when your bet becomes reality: fixed payout and pari mutuel payout.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fixed Payout</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the most straightforward. A fixed payout is like reserving your prize money upfront. When you place your bet, your possible winnings are locked in right away and do not change later on.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, if you buy 300 \"YES\" shares, you will get 300 points if you are right. It's like putting 300 coins in your piggy bank for a rainy day. The only thing that matters is if your guess is right or wrong – all action after you bet does not affect your payout.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Pari Mutuel Payout</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This method pays out by dividing the prize pool between all bettors who won the bet. It's a prize pool where all winning players get their fair share. The more people who win, the smaller each prize will be. The fewer winners, the bigger your share.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both have advantages and disadvantages – fixed payout ensures knowing your return, while parimutuel could turn in your favor if you take the contrarian side of a bet and win.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">History of Prediction Markets in Crypto</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prediction markets are not a new concept in crypto. In 2020, the now-collapsed FTX exchange introduced a similar type of market where users could bet on future events like elections and token prices.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the notable examples was the \"TRUMP2024\" market that centered around whether Donald Trump would run for president again in 2024. Participants could buy (long) or sell (short) contract tokens representing each outcome – if Trump ran, the tokens expired to $1, and if not, became worthless at $0.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Essentially, these \"bets\" involved going long or short on future contract tokens. However, current prediction markets differentiate in that traders purchase outcome shares rather than going long or short. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, with the bankruptcy of FTX, the TRUMP2024 market will never be settled (on FTX). Another reminder how centralization could pose risks to participants just wanting to bet. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"FTX Trump Prediction Market\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9144/content_image4.webp\" style=\"height: 422px; width: 950px;\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Real Time Sentiment Barometer?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The name \"prediction markets\" can give a misleading impression, because there is more to it. While predicting outcomes is one goal, prediction markets could also serve as a real-time tool to gauge how people dynamically value and price near-term events.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding this shifting sentiment can provide insight into developing stories and tell us perhaps more about what really is happening and what is not.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Blockchain-based prediction markets may be the one force strong enough to counterbalance the spread of incorrect information on social media. They give people a financial incentive to seek the truth and then protect them with the twin shields of pseudonymity and decentralization.</p>\n— Balaji (@balajis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1087069353688715264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 20, 2019</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While prediction markets could function as sentiment barometers, liquidity remains crucial, as always. As with any market, accuracy tends to improve when volume is high. Some markets have (extremely) low <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a>, thus limiting insights into true expectations. On top of that, we must consider that an event not coming to fruition does not necessarily mean the implied odds were low or vice versa.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Significance of Crypto in Prediction Markets</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While traditional markets normally only use fiat currency, prediction markets in crypto are unique in their use of cryptocurrency for both placing bets and collecting payouts.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The cryptocurrencies used are <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-stablecoins-top-5-stablecoins-by-market-cap\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins </a>that are perfectly suited for this purpose. Foremost, the transparency of the blockchain ledger allows full visibility and takes away doubts that users are betting against an opaque third party \"house\".</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, these stablecoins remain stable and are under the self-custody of each user. Users will only interact through smart contracts and will not deposit cryptocurrencies into a centralized wallet. Lastly, the decentralized nature of crypto makes it possible for anyone from anywhere in the world to use the market, regardless of their location, except for restricted countries.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some well-known crypto prediction markets we will explore are separated into non-sports and sports prediction markets. Let's take a look at crypto prediction markets that focus on more than just sports. The projects in the list below are listed in order of the size of their X (Twitter) following: </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Polymarket: Largest Prediction Market Powered By Crypto</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://polymarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Polymarket</a> is the largest and most popular prediction market in the crypto space. It has the highest liquidity and is most frequently quoted on Crypto Twitter. Polymarket allows its users to access the prediction markets through USDC, a stablecoin 1:1 pegged to the dollar.</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"Polymarket Dashboard\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11138/content_Polymarket.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 364px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sadly, due to regulatory issues Polymarket is forbidden from letting U.S. citizens trade on its platform. However, people of the U.S. can still view information on the markets.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Does Polymarket Work?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just as explained in the previous section, the price or odds represent the current probability of an event occurring according to the market assessment.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example: In a prediction market on whether Sam Bankman Fried, the former FTX CEO, will be sentenced to 50+ years in federal prison or not, the “Yes” shares trading at 31c indicate that the market thinks there is a 31% chance that he will.</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"Prediction Market SBF Jailtime\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9146/content_image2.webp\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ultimate outcome of whether SBF is sentenced to 50 or more years in prison will be known by 11:59 PM ET on June 30, 2024.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If traders betting \"Yes\" are right, this means SBF gets a hard sentence of 50+ years, and each “Yes” share would be worth $1. That’s a 69c profit per 31c share price. Any trader who owned “No” shares would see their investment become worthless. This is peer-to-peer trading.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it's important to mention that you're not locked into your bet. If you change your opinion, you can sell your position at the current odds anytime before the market ends. So you can always sell when odds seem to shift and you do not want to sit it through until the final verdict.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're wondering about the results, the final outcome was \"No.\"</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Limit Orders and Rewards</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An extra feature of Polymarket is that it allows users to place <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/take-profit-and-stop-loss-levels\" target=\"_blank\">limit orders</a> in the order book. This means you won’t have to buy or sell instantly and could bid or ask a lower or higher price than the current market price, similar to regular trading. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On top of that, Polymarket rewards those who fill the order book, similar to maker fees, with rewards being paid out on a weekly basis. For more information on rewards, please visit their official <a href=\"https://learn.polymarket.com/trading-rewards\">documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Getting Started on Polymarket</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Getting started requires knowing how to use a self-custody wallet and transferring cryptocurrency. This is a straightforward process.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Create Account and Deposit USDC</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, create an account on Polymarket, which can be done with a Google account or by connecting your Coinbase wallet or many of the most <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/metamask-alternatives\" target=\"_blank\">popular self-custody wallets</a>.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After creating an account, it's time to deposit money to bet with, in this case USDC. Note that you can export your private key, so you control your funds in a wallet of your choice. You can import your Polymarket wallet into another wallet provider, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask\" target=\"_blank\">MetaMask</a>.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Make Your First Trade</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before making your first trade, explore the available markets on Polymarket to find one you want to predict. Read the market details carefully and understand what position you are taking. Check the liquidity and use the built-in calculator to see potential returns.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Decide on your position and click \"Yes\" or \"No\" to place your bet, then enter the amount you wish to wager. As mentioned above, it is possible to create limit orders by specifying your preferred buy or sell price and amount.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Polymarket Buy and Sell\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9147/content_image3.webp\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Monitor and Cash Out if Right</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are in a bet or have limit orders set, monitor the market closely. Good luck!</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Drift: BET with 30 Crypto as Collateral</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.drift.trade/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Drift Protocol</a> is a decentralized exchange also built on the Solana blockchain. It expanded its protocol with a new offering and the introduction of BET (Betting Earn Terms), a capital-efficient prediction market. BET allows users not only to bet on outcomes like the U.S. election, but also earn yields on their bets as events unfold.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Drift BET\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11141/content_Drift_BET.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 680px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike other prediction platforms, BET allows users to trade using any <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-collateral-defi?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">collateral</a> available on the Drift Protocol, which includes around 30 different crypto assets, including yield-bearing stablecoins such as PyUSD and USDY. This could be a way for users to hedge their bets, setting BET apart from other prediction markets by not being limited to standard options like USDC.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Drift Labs also plans to manage its prediction markets with an in-house security council that will list and arbitrate markets, a different approach than other prediction market methods where users can create markets themselves. Currently this could result in the betting options being rather limited on the platform.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Polkamarkets: The Automated Market Maker Prediction Market</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.polkamarkets.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Polkamarkets</a> is a prediction market that operates on Ethereum Mainnet, as well as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/moonbeam-cross-chain-smart-contract-platform-polkadot\" target=\"_blank\">Moonbeam and Moonriver</a>, but sees most activity on Polygon. Users can directly take positions on real-world event outcomes from within MetaMask, using the stablecoin USDT to interact with the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contracts</a>.</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"Polkamarkets Dashboard\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9148/content_image9.webp\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 535px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Does Polkamarkets Work?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process is the same as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>For example, a prediction market on Polymarket where Ledger, the hardware wallet company, will file for bankruptcy before June 1, 2024, has a \"No\" share trading at 67c. This implies the market thinks there is a 67% chance it will not file for bankruptcy. If this outcome occurs (the company does file bankruptcy), all those who voted \"Yes\" will be paid out $1 on their 33c share. This follows the same structure of what we've seen before.</em></p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Prediction Market Ledger Bankruptcy\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9149/content_image7.webp\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 447px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But where Polkamarket differs is that they use an automated market maker (<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm\" target=\"_blank\">AMM</a>) similar to Uniswap. This offers the advantage of constant liquidity, making markets more accessible and eliminating the need for traditional order books. Pricing will be algorithmically adjusted and incentivizes liquidity providers with a share of transaction fees.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The downside of AMMs is the risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers when asset prices change and potential price <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/slippage-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">slippage</a> in low liquidity conditions. So caution is needed when adding liquidity to these markets.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Zeitgeist: Prediction Market On Polkadot</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://app.zeitgeist.pm/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zeitgeist</a> has its own prediction market which is a decentralized platform built on the Kusama network, designed to allow users to speculate on the outcomes of future events. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The market is very new and does not have a lot of liquidity. It uses its native token, ZTG, for creating markets and enabling users to buy or sell shares in the outcome of an event. Users can use Polkadot-compatible wallets such as Talisman, Polkadot.js, or SubWallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Zeitgeist\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11145/content_Zeitgeist.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 297px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From all the generalized prediction markets discussed above, Polymarket is definitely in first place in the non-sports prediction markets, primarily focusing on political events. But with the emergence of new markets, we see a revival in sports betting facilitated by blockchain, although this also falls closely under the category of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-gamblefi-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Gamblefi</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Limitless: Prediction Market on Base</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://limitless.exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Limitless</a>, which runs on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/base-coinbase-layer-2?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Base</a>, represents another prediction market where users can create their own markets and have the opportunity to earn rewards by actively participating. The platform allows users to predict outcomes in diverse fields such as crypto, tech, and sports.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the Limitless prediction market is rather small in comparison to other platforms, they see more and more relative growth, with all-time volume increasing and also an increase in weekly active users.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Limitless\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11143/content_Limitless.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 684px;\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">SX Network: Escrow Prediction Market</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"SX Network\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11148/content_SX_Network.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 516px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its inception in March 2019, <a href=\"https://sx.bet/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SX Network</a> has been the longest-running web3 betting platform to date, and after the successful closure of a $9.5 million fundraising round, their own custom EVM-compatible blockchain handles every aspect of the betting process, from market creation to settlement, all performed on-chain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process of creating and settling betting markets in the SX protocol is streamlined and efficient. Here’s how it unfolds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Markets are created through either a sports market API or manually via a market creator GUI dApp.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Once these details are defined, a unique market hash is generated and stored in the Market Registry.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">After the creation of a market hash, participants can start offering and accepting bets. As soon as a bet is offered and accepted, the crypto assets from both bettors are atomically transferred to an Escrow contract.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These assets remain in the Escrow Contract until the event is concluded and the market creator reports the outcome. There are only three valid outcomes for reporting: Outcome1, Outcome2, and Void. Should a market be declared Void—for reasons such as cancellation, postponement, or a tied result—both participants receive their stakes back without any fees.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"SX Network betting\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11149/content_SX_Network_betting.webp\" style=\"width: 768px; height: 696px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike conventional setups where users can only accept bets offered by the sportsbook, SX Bet enables users to both offer and accept bets.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Hedgehog Markets: Biggest on Solana</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://hedgehog.markets/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hedgehog Markets</a>, a generalized prediction market, launched on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-solana-sol-and-how-does-it-work?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a> and closed a $3.5 million seed funding round in 2022. They expanded their offerings by launching peer-to-peer markets and an automated market maker (AMM). </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users can create and participate in binary markets with selectable odds. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing clear evidence of trades and allowing public access to the market data.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Hedgehog\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11139/content_Hedgehog.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 527px;\"></div>\n\n<p>On top of that, users have the opportunity to stake their predictions, adding an additional layer of engagement and potential earning. This can be done in pooled predictions where multiple users contribute to a collective prediction pool, earning a passive yield from trading volumes in a way that attracts more <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> to the Hedgehog markets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hedgehog has parimutuel pools that don't require market makers. This works well for fun PvP style bets, but some people will want the familiar trading experience of knowing your odds and payout going in, with the ability to sell your shares anytime.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Hedgehog pools\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11140/content_Hedgehog_pools.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 338px;\"></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Overtime: Betting on Sport With ERC-20 Tokens</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Overtime Markets</a>, a web3 sportsbook built on Thales, followed a successful public beta phase and saw over $3,000,000 in volume and had more than 3,000 unique users.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Overtime\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11151/content_Overtime.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 683px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Built on the Thales Protocol, an established and permissionless, order book-based peer-to-peer Positional Markets platform that initially deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet, but now has integrations across various blockchain platforms like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overtime supports live betting and a variety of stablecoins and ETH for transactions. Each market runs within a dedicated smart contract that enables the minting of UP and DOWN ERC-20 tokens, using USD as collateral. At market expiry, the outcome (UP or DOWN) relative to the Strike Price determines which token can be redeemed for the total USD collateral, as reported by Chainlink.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Manifold Markets: Predicting for Charity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManifoldMarkets\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Manifold Markets</a> is a prediction site that is easy to use and has an interesting feature - it donates rewards to charities. Although Manifold does not run on the blockchain or use crypto, it uses its own digital play money called Mana (M).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All users start with M500 for free. Mana can be used to create, subsidize, and promote markets on your own questions. In addition, you can purchase more mana or convert your mana earnings into real <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/charity\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">charitable donations</a> at a rate of M100 for $1.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps Manifold will introduce crypto to its platform in the future, or maybe not – we can bet on this prediction using Manifold. Either way, it's a win-win situation.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Manifold\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11150/content_Manifold.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 421px;\"></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Swaye: Prediction Market for Degens</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://swaye.co/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Swaye</a>, currently in its open beta phase, is a prediction market platform that allows users to create and participate in prediction markets. Swaye introduces a platform designed by and for those who thrive on making speculative predictions, commonly known as 'degens'.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prizes on Swaye are distributed based on the performance of traders in terms of profit and loss (PnL), and top performers are recognized weekly. This is different than other prediction markets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's also important to note that for potential and current users of Swaye that the platform is still in an open beta phase. This means that while the platform is fully operational, the smart contracts governing transactions and activities are unaudited.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Swaye\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11144/content_Swaye.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 400px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Inertia: Mobile Friendly Prediction Market</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.inertia.social/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inertia</a>, built on Avalanche, is a prediction market that is not yet launched but garnered attention when they secured the first place at Codebase's inaugural Demo Day.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Inertia platform is, according to them, designed for both the \"hyper degenerate\" and the \"normie\" in our space. A place where anyone with a topic they are passionate about can create a market.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What could be unique to Inertia is that they are developing a mobile-first application, as they understand that other prediction markets are sometimes hindered by being desktop-first.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Prediction Markets Infrastructure Platforms</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond prediction market platforms, the prediction markets vertical also consists of platforms that aim to facilitate and simplify the building of prediction applications.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Azuro: Building Prediction Applications in 5 Minutes</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://azuro.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Azuro</a> is more than a prediction market, it is a platform that simplifies building prediction applications altogether. With over <a href=\"https://azuro.org/ecosystem\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">several independent apps</a> built on Azuro and 28,000 users, you could say they are the runner up in the prediction markets niche and drive a big chunk of the prediction volume.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After closing three venture rounds totaling $11 million, with notable investments from Gnosis, Azuro provides tooling and resources that ensure developers can launch their applications in just five minutes and could open up new revenue streams.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What is important is that Azuro employs a Liquidity Pool design, called the Liquidity Tree, intended to create and maintain market liquidity.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Liquidity Tree model is a smarter way to organize compared to older methods. It helps manage digital assets better by allowing them to be very specific about where and how they put them to work—careful placement that can prevent money from being wasted when making trades (reducing <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/slippage-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">slippage</a>) and help make the most out of the invested money (optimizing capital usage).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By organizing the money into a tree-like structure, where each branch can have different amounts and types of money, investors (liquidity providers or LPs) can choose exactly where they want to invest.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Azuro users\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11146/content_Azuro_users.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 726px;\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Monaco: Prediction Building Layer on Solana</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Run on Solana, the <a href=\"https://www.monacoprotocol.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monaco Protocol</a> also operates as a base for applications to be built upon. It operates as a single, decentralized betting pool that connects all compatible prediction markets and apps together. The protocol is non-custodial, and utilizes smart contracts to automatically settle bets in a trustless manner.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It has a global liquidity network that means individuals have access to more options for placing bets as well as larger pools of money providing tighter price spreads.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Monaco liquidity network\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11147/content_Monaco_liquidity_network.webp\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 563px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A key breakthrough of the Monaco Protocol is its handling of markets where betting occurs in play, like live sports. Using a technique called “off-chain cranking,” short delays are introduced between order placement and matching. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This prevents anyone from taking unfair advantage of in-game situations unfolding in real time. Several betting platforms have been built in Monaco, where all of them are sport centered betting exchanges.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Will Prediction Markets Remain Niche?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite their effectiveness, prediction markets remain niche, primarily due to liquidity issues. Providing liquidity is risky because of impermanent losses as liquidity providers may lose money if market prices move too quickly in one direction.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To mitigate this risk, successful prediction markets limit themselves to events with predetermined outcome dates and minimal partial insights, such as sports competitions or elections. While this approach attracts liquidity, it significantly narrows the scope of applicable questions.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key idea is that prediction markets incentivize people to reveal their true beliefs through putting money where their mouth is. As more people bet, the market prices integrate into an accurate probabilistic forecast determined by the market. This could be considered a powerful forecasting tool for events with uncertain outcomes, although the wisdom of the crowd is in some cases close to room temperature IQ.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only for informational and educational purposes, and should not be taken as financial or investment advice.

Some of these include high entry barriers as well as the centralization of validator pools. Puffer aims to make <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-restaking-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">restaking</a> on EigenLayer more accessible and allow users to run an Ethereum PoS validator. The liquid restaking protocol went live on February 1 this year and gained a total value locked (TVL) of $146 million on the first day. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By staking ETH on Puffer, users can play a part in securing the Ethereum network while earning yield and rewards. To encourage more users to participate, staking on the platform has no minimum amount requirement. Stakers who deposit ETH will receive the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pufeth\" target=\"_blank\">pufETH</a> native Liquid Restaking Token (nLRT) through the PufferVault contract. A nLRT generates restaking rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer but unlike other <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-liquid-staking-liquid-staked-derivatives-you-need-to-know?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquid staking tokens</a>, it is able to provide more rewards to holders because it encompasses both PoS rewards and restaking rewards. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, where a typical validator has to stake 32 ETH to participate, anyone can operate a validator on Puffer with as little as 1 ETH. The protocol makes use of a unique concept called “Validator Tickets” that runs similarly to “Execution Tickets” on Ethereum. The validator tickets are ERC20 tokens that give the holder the right to run an Ethereum validator for a day. Node operators need to mint validator tickets by depositing ETH, and the price of a validator ticket is set based on the expected daily earnings from running a validator. When registering a validator, the node operator must lock 1 ETH worth of pufETH and deposit at least 28 validator tickets. In exchange, they are provided 32 ETH to run a validator and will receive 100% of the rewards they produce for as many days they are entitled to. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Puffer has a burst threshold mechanism in place as part of its efforts to ensure the protocol never breaches the consensus threshold of 33% which would threaten Ethereum’s stability. To do this, Puffer is committed to self-capping its validator marketshare to 22% of Etherem’s validator set. As the number of validators grows on the platform, the burst threshold mechanism will begin to limit the number of mintable validator tickets to an amount that can only sustain existing validators. This mechanism allows Puffer to cap the number of validators to the predetermined 22% and indirectly reduce the demand from new stakers.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Puffer Finance has raised a total of $24.47 million over the past two years with the most recent round being a Series A that successfully raised $18 million. The round was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Electric Capital with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Brands, ConsenSys, and more. On top of that, Binance Labs invested an undisclosed amount in Puffer Finance in January 2024.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Puffer is now developing UniFi – its flagship Based Rollup – designed to streamline Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and improve transaction speeds, security, and overall experience. In anticipation of the upcoming launch of Puffer UniFi, users can now explore UniFi through a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/galxe-gal?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Galxe</a> quest as well as participate in Puffy’s Crunchy Carrot Quest Chapter 4 to earn points.

But getting that game in front of players is an entirely different venture! In the olden days, when digital downloads were still young and consoles relied on CDs and DVDs, players would have to visit different websites in order to purchase and download their games – managing numerous logins and trusting their credit card info to a variety of different sources.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But from this chaos rose Steam, the centralized game platform who changed the face of digital distribution. Launched in 2003, Steam now sees about 69 million players visiting their platform on a daily basis! And though there are other game distribution platforms, Steam is by far the most dominant. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, something interesting happened related to the world of blockchain gaming and game distribution. In 2021, Steam pushed the entire blockchain gaming industry away, stating that they wouldn’t allow any games on their platform that used crypto or NFTs!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Game distribution platforms not only give their users a single place to install, download, and update their games, but they are also an excellent marketing avenue, giving developers a chance to put their game in front of all sorts of players.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To fill the distribution void left by Steam ignoring the industry, several other developers have jumped on the chance to offer their services instead.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And though still just a very small portion of the global gaming industry, web3 gaming is growing quickly. In this article we’ll take a look at the current state of web3 gaming distribution, and what to expect in the future.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Accessing Web3 Gaming</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For quite a while now, web3 gaming has been mostly a niche industry. There have been times where it came more to the forefront of the general public, particularly during the play to earn frenzy of 2021 when every mint was a sellout, token and NFT prices were only rising, and some people were actually making a living wage just by playing web3 games!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But ease of access has long been a hindrance to bringing new players into the blockchain gaming scene. Crypto has a reputation for being shady in general, and those who aren’t familiar with it are often instantly turned off at the mention of NFTs or blockchain in their games. On top of that, having to deal with a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-wallet-vs-exchange?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">wallet</a> and managing your seed phrase and getting money into your wallet and creating a login for the game – well, all of this can quickly become overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And so, there has been an ongoing push for some time to try and make things easier for players. Universal logins such as Immutable Passport and MOCA ID are one part of the equation, but another is simply getting the games into players’ hands.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If your game is completely web-based, then you’re already good to go as far as game distribution. Every computer, phone, TV, maybe even your dishwasher, has a web browser these days.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But if you have an app the players need to download, then you’ll want a way to distribute your game. And sure, a download link on your webpage is great. But third party platforms remove the burden of hosting your own download servers while also serving as a global marketing system.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Gaming Consoles</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Probably not where you expected this to start. But the recent playtest of Off the Grid on the PS5, featuring over 30k players, was in many ways a watershed moment for blockchain gaming.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Off the Grid on PlayStation Store\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11067/content_Capture.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 594px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Off the Grid is a battle-royale style shooter, built on the Avalanche blockchain. They’re been in development for a while and have had other playtests, but this is their first on a console, and the first ever web3 game played on a major gaming console.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The playtesters are under an NDA (non-disclosure agreement), so we haven’t heard many details from this console playtest, but the overall sentiment seems to be positive. Some enthusiastic players even went so far as to purchase a PS5 just for this playtest!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sony has not released any official stance in regards to blockchain games on their consoles, but this event is a good sign. Perhaps this is just the beginning of what will soon be a flood of web3 game development for consoles. The Playstation Network alone sees 116 million active users, so there is certainly a large market of players available in the gaming console world!</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Steam and Web3 Gaming</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steam, long a behemoth in the game distribution industry, opted a while back to simply ban blockchain games from their platform entirely.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, though this policy announcement scared off many web3 developers, it seems that Steam isn’t particularly attentive to their self-imposed restriction. Some blockchain based games have gotten around the ban by creating two versions of the game – one for Steam with no direct blockchain integrations, and a second version for everyone else. Meanwhile others, such as Boss Fighters, are just building away on Steam, with seemingly no cares in the world!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But whatever the end result is, Steam has placed themselves at the back of the pack for web3 game distribution with their announcement. And they have shown no signs of actively changing their policy, opening the way for other players in the space to step in.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Rise of Epic Games</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With monthly active users in the range of 60-70 million, Epic Games is already a significant player in game distribution, though not quite as large as Steam. However, from the early days, Epic Games has embraced web3 gaming, letting blockchain-enabled games list and distribute through the Epic Games Store.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"a few of the web3 games available on the Epic Games Store\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11062/content_image1.webp\" style=\"width: 1113px; height: 512px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Epic Games platform is still dominated by web2 games, but their web3 portfolio is expanding. Already numbering in the dozens, expect to see even more blockchain games launch through Epic Games, as it has quickly become one of the major go-to platforms for web3 game distribution.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Epic Games continues to expand their reach, having just opened up the first mobile version of their store. The game options on mobile are limited at the moment, but this number will likely grow rapidly.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Epic Games offers a generous 88% / 12% revenue split with game developers publishing on their platform. And, if you have a new game that hasn’t been published on any other 3rd party platform beforehand, you can even apply for a special program called First Run, which gives you 100% of the game sales proceeds for the first six months!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With their continued support for blockchain games, as well as traditional digital games, Epic Games is in a prime position to become the leading distribution platform for web3 gaming!</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Hyperplay</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whereas Epic Games hosts both web3 and web2 games, Hyperplay is focused solely on web3 game distribution. They have even built their own gaming reward system, Hyperplay Quests, linked to playing games through the Hyperplay launcher. Players can earn tokens, points, and even NFTs through this system.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Hyperplay Quests\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11063/content_image4.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 772px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They also let you connect to other platforms such as Epic Games and Good Old Games, providing a one-stop access point for your gaming needs. You can access Hyperplay Quests, as well as all the games across all three accounts (Hyperplay, Epic, and GoG) all through the Hyperplay app.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And though not in the news as much as Epic Games, Hyperplay has been growing as well, with titles such as Might Action Heroes, Uldor, Xociety, and Medieval Empires. With over 100 titles distributed through their platform, and a growing social media presence, Hyperplay is focused on claiming their share of the digital distribution pie. They still have a long way to go to challenge Steam or even Epic, but they seem to be off to a good start!</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Google Play and the Apple Store</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mobile-based web3 games are already all over the official mobile app marketplaces. You can play and earn with games such as Wild Forest, Heroes of Mavia, and Guild of Guardians – just to name a few. Many desktop-oriented games such as Gods Unchained offer mobile apps as well.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though both Google and Apple have various restrictions and requirements on blockchain games, developers will jump through the hoops to get their games in front of a mobile gaming audience.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And with mobile comprising an estimated 49% of the gaming market revenue, and entertaining over 3 billion players (source: <a href=\"https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/mobile-gaming-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Udonis</a>) you can understand why! Mobile gaming is a prime target for the continued growth of the web3 game industry, and expect to see many more blockchain games making their way onto the mobile app stores over the coming months.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Chain-Specific Distribution Platforms</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then there are a number of chain-specific game / app distribution platforms, geared towards their native blockchain. Some of the most prominent are the Gala Launcher (GalaChain), Mavis Hub (Ronin), Telegram (TON chain), and the Hytopia launcher (Hychain).</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Gala Launcher</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gala Games created their own launcher to help run games on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-galachain-gala-web3-gaming-entertainment?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">GalaChain</a> ecosystem. Known as the Gala Launcher, this is your central download source for games such as Spider Tanks, Champions Arena, and all the other titles on GalaChain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Gala launcher is just for their games at the moment. But, with their Gala Music and Gala Films divisions, Gala could potentially expand and create a really cool app that lets users access their games, film, and music all in one place.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GalaChain uses a distributed node system, giving node owners a chance to support the network and earn rewards which include <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala\" target=\"_blank\">GALA tokens</a> as well as various token and NFT airdrops. You can learn more about the Gala Founder’s Node and even purchase your own on the <a href=\"https://games.gala.com/nodes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">official webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Mavis Hub (Sky Mavis)</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sky Mavis, developers of Axie and all of the Axie spin-offs, also built their own chain (<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-ronin-network-ron-blockchain-for-gaming?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ronin Network</a>), and their own game launcher, the Mavis Hub. Players can download, install, and run all of the Axie games as well as many other games on the Ronin Network with this one launcher.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And while this game distribution platform is limited in scope, Ronin Network has been making noise lately, with recent game additions such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/definitive-beginners-guide-pixels-web3-game?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Pixels</a>, Wild Forest, and The Machines Arena bolstering the number of players on the network. The Mavis Hub app functions much like Steam and Epic Games. Users can browse, install, and launch the available games, read up on patch notes, learn about upcoming events, and even vote on the next games to be added to the platform with the Mavis Hub Greenlight program!</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"some games available through Sky Mavis Hub\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11065/content_image2.webp\" style=\"width: 952px; height: 862px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Ronin Network claims to be the number one gaming chain with 1.5 million Daily Active Addresses (DAA). With over 15 million wallet addresses created, and $1.36 billion in value locked on the chain, this gaming-centric network isn’t going anywhere and will remain a player in the gaming scene for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Ronin network stats\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11064/content_image5.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Image from <a href=\"https://x.com/Ronin_Network/status/1815560873588715914\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ronin Network’s mid-year review</a>.</span></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Open Network (TON)</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Who would have ever expected Telegram to be the hot commodity in web3 gaming?! With Telegram’s already existing user base of millions, game developers have been quick to jump onto the new <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-ton-toncoin-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">TON chain</a>, taking advantage of the integrated services to bring their games directly into the Telegram app. For the most part, these games have been relatively simple ones, with the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-tap-2-earn-crypto-top-tap-to-earn-games?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">tap to earn</a> frenzy dominating the headlines. But Telegram is rapidly adding new features, and the game developers are building even more complex apps.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/toncoin\" target=\"_blank\">TON token</a> has rapidly grown as well, becoming the 9th largest cryptocurrency (by market cap) in existence! The Open Network boasts over 50 million accounts created, with nearly 13 million active wallets, and over 3.5 million transactions per day. The Open Network is run by 370 validators across 29 different countries.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With their rapid expansion and adoption of blockchain technology, and their millions of users, Telegram is in a prime spot to bring web3 gaming to the masses. Expect to hear a lot more from them over the coming months. And it will be very interesting to see if the games on their platform can expand beyond the tap-to-earn craze and find ways to keep players engaged for the long-term.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hytopia Launcher</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Formerly NFT Worlds, Hytopia has not only completely rebooted their original Minecraft-style game, but they have also built their own network to support it (Hychain), and any other developers who are interested in taking advantage of their player and developer friendly ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Hytopia launcher does have an advantage over many of these others as it features an in-app NFT marketplace. Players can buy and sell NFTs, manage their game accounts, and install and launch games all without leaving the app!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This feature has the potential to help break the barrier between NFT owners and regular players, making the trading of NFTs a completely seamless process so that players may not even realize that they are dealing with NFTs!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Loot Legends is the first non-Hytopia game to build on Hychain and is currently in and early playtest. Hytopia Worlds is in beta testing, with an official launch expected this year (2024).</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Got Any Games on Your Samsung TV?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Smart’ TVs are ubiquitous in many homes these days. And as one of the larger players in the television scene, Samsung has some weight to throw around. Not only have they made partnerships with various web3 games to offer NFT rewards , but they even have their own NFT – one that even offers actual utility to the holders!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, if you pick up their special <a href=\"https://gen3.samsung.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">web3 TV bundle</a>, it comes with a Ledger Nano and a GEN3RATOR NFT, which grants access to sweepstakes, discounts, events, and feature activations. Users holding both GEN3RATOR and Samsung Gen3 Chip NFTs can also exclusively access 2,000 digital artworks from partner projects.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And in a recent announcement, Samsung has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-illuvium?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Illuvium</a> to bring all three of the Illuvium games onto Samsung TVs. This is big news for Samsung as they venture even further into web3 adoption, but even bigger news for Illuvium who will have their games put in front of a larger audience!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Will smart TVs become a main source of game distribution in the future? Probably not by themselves. But perhaps we will see some integrations and partnerships with game platforms moving forward that make smart TVs more gaming-centric.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Samsung web3 tv bundle\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11066/content_image3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 415px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Looking to the Future</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Web3 gaming is not just about overpriced NFTs and play to earn click-grinds anymore. It has evolved to a point where the game is more often the primary focus – with blockchain features serving as  enhancements rather than the reason for the game’s existence.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But, the audience for web3 games has still been somewhat limited. That will change quickly over the coming years, and even months. Big name players in the gaming industry like Ubisoft and CCP and Konami are venturing further into blockchain gaming, with some diving in wholeheartedly.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And a large part of the future of web3 gaming will be pushing the games into these distribution channels. Not only to make the games more accessible, but also to get them in front of the millions of gamers around the world who have little to no interest in blockchain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As web3 games develop, we will see the blockchain tech pushed more into the background. Seamless integration to make things easier for the users is an important part of attracting more players, and the game developers know it. Integrating with existing apps and giving users familiar interfaces will be an important part of the process.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many web3 games also don’t follow the traditional gaming revenue models. Most offer their games up as free to play – relying on direct NFT sales, in-game purchases, and revenue from secondary NFT trades instead of the traditional up-front, game purchase.That lack of normalized revenue may be part of what turned Steam away from blockchain gaming. But it’s also an important part of the web3 gaming scene, giving developers of all skill and funding levels a chance to pursue their dreams of creating the next hot game!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Web3 gaming is really just getting started. With the more widely accepted distribution options such as the Apple and Play stores, and Epic Games letting web3 developers put their games in front of the platforms’ users we will see more and more players joining in on blockchain gaming – perhaps some without even knowing! </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And that seems like a worthy goal for blockchain technology – to be so integrated that you don’t even know it’s there!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only for educational and informational purposes, and should not be taken as investment advice.

These cards are typically issued by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-centralized-crypto-exchanges-cex?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> and financial institutions, enabling users to make purchases and even withdraw fiat currency using their digital assets. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Crypto cards are a type of payment card that allows holders to spend their digital assets — just like fiat money — in their everyday life.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There are three main types of crypto cards, and they include debit, credit, and prepaid cards.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">These cards make it easy to spend cryptocurrency like traditional money, whether online or in physical stores, without needing to manually convert to fiat first.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In this article, we’ve curated a list of the top crypto cards in the market, highlighting features, costs, and fee structure.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Top Crypto Cards\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11112/content_Top_Crypto_Cards.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While cryptocurrency has a growing presence in the global finance industry over the past decade, these digital assets are yet to be widely adopted and accepted by governments and businesses worldwide.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result, it's not that easy for people to use cryptocurrencies in the real world, which potentially discourages widespread adoption of digital assets. To tackle these challenges, we are seeing the introduction of different solutions to enable users to spend their cryptocurrencies in the real world, including crypto cards. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Types of Crypto Cards</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto cards basically eliminate the need to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency before spending, bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. Now, these cards come in different types; credit, debit, and prepaid. Each type offers unique characteristics, catering to different needs and preferences.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Crypto debit cards</strong>, for instance, work by linking directly to a digital asset wallet. When you make a purchase, the card automatically <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/bitcoin-vs-fiat-currencies\" target=\"_blank\">converts the required amount of crypto into fiat currency</a> at the point of sale. This type of card is convenient for everyday spending and can be used both online and in physical stores. Additionally, users can withdraw cash from ATMs that support the card.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, <strong>crypto credit cards</strong> operate similarly to traditional credit cards except that they offer rewards in cryptocurrency. Users can make purchases and pay off the balance later, earning crypto rewards in the process. These cards often come with benefits, such as cashback, making them an attractive option for those looking to maximize their crypto holdings.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, <strong>crypto prepaid cards</strong> are another type of crypto cards. It allows users to load specific amounts of cryptocurrency, which are then converted to fiat currency for various purposes. These cards are particularly useful for budgeting, as users can only spend the preloaded amount, thereby helping them manage their finances more efficiently. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Do Crypto Cards Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto cards operate similarly to traditional debit or credit cards. To begin using a crypto card, one must first choose a card service provider and sign up for an account on their platform. This process may involve verifying their identity by providing personal information and necessary documents. This step is especially crucial for complying with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/kyc-know-your-customer\" target=\"_blank\">Know-Your-Customer (KYC)</a> regulations.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the account is created and verified, users can then link their cryptocurrency wallet to the crypto card account. Although some cards come with built-in wallets, users can transfer cryptocurrency from their external wallet to the card's wallet. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When making purchases physically, users can swipe, insert, or tap their card at the payment terminal. Then, the required amount of cryptocurrency is converted to fiat currency in real-time, ensuring the latest exchange rate. For online shopping, you enter your card details at checkout, and the conversion happens. If you need to withdraw cash, you can use the crypto card at compatible ATMs, with the cryptocurrency converted at the time of withdrawal.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most notably, crypto cards often come with standard security features such as a PIN, chip, and two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure the safety of transactions. Additionally, providers monitor transactions for suspicious activity and allow users to freeze their cards immediately, if they are lost or compromised.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a comprehensive list of the top crypto cards, highlighting their various features, offerings, and benefits to users. We’ll start with looking at cards issued by major centralized exchanges and institutions, before looking at some non-custodial card options available.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Coinbase Card: Debit Card With Crypto Rewards</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Coinbase Card is a debit card designed by one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, allowing users to draw on their Coinbase account crypto balances to make payments in crypto. The crypto card stands out for its ability to turn everyday purchases into crypto rewards.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Coinbase Card\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11070/content_Screen_Shot_2024-08-05_at_02.40.37.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 645px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: Coinbase</span></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Features</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Coinbase Card is a Visa debit card that offers several features, including; </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Support for eight (8) cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Earn cashback rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Card is valid anywhere Visa debit cards are accepted.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Zero spending and annual fees.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Robust security features, like two-factor authentication, card freezing, and PIN change.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Available in Europe, the UK, and the US. </p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Cost and Fees</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/card\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coinbase Card</a> does not charge annual fees or spending fees, making it a cost-effective option for users. However, network transaction fees (e.g. gas fees) still apply for transferring cryptocurrency off the platform and are always disclosed at the time of the transaction. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also, fees for buying, selling, or converting cryptocurrencies on Coinbase depend on factors like payment method and order size. While spending with the Coinbase card has no transaction fees, ATM operators may charge fees for withdrawals.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, this card offers flexible funding options, allowing users to link their bank accounts or deposit part of their paycheck into Coinbase with zero fees. The setup process is straightforward, with no credit check or requirement to stake assets to become eligible. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Crypto.com Card: Prepaid Card With Private Jet Perks</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://crypto.com/en/cards.html\">Crypto.com card</a> is another custodial card ideal for users looking to spend or convert their digital assets with ease. Moreover, this crypto card enables users to maximize their cryptocurrency holdings through spending and staking rewards. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Crypto.com\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11111/content_Crypto.com_cards.webp\" style=\"width: 1074px; height: 632px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: Crypto.com</span></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Features</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Crypto.com card is a prepaid card that offers several tiers, each with its unique privileges, depending on the amount of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cronos\" target=\"_blank\">CRO</a> (Crypto.com's native token) staked.

In addition, the card can be used at various merchants globally where Visa cards are accepted. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Cost and Fees</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are no annual or spending fees, however, there are specific limits on free ATM withdrawals per month. These limits range from $200 USD for Midnight Blue to $1,000 USD for Obsidian. Any withdrawals beyond these limits, or those processed by ATM operators, may incur additional fees. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users can top up their cards with bank transfers, other credit/debit cards, or cryptocurrency, where all cryptocurrency is converted to fiat currency before being used for purchases or withdrawals. Depending on your location, there may be additional administrative charges when topping up with a credit card.

These cards provide users with convenience, enhanced security, and unique benefits, including cashback rewards, staking options, and subscription packages. That said, choosing a suitable crypto card can be a complex decision-making process involving a few relevant considerations, such as taxes, custody, flexibility, regulations, and more.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Always do your own research before choosing any crypto cards or staking any digital assets.

The platform aims to help these modular blockchains and dApps attract more Total Value Locked (TVL) by leveraging community-owned liquidity rather than relying on mercenary capital.</p>\n\n<p>Mitosis is currently in development, with its vaults operational but the public testnet for the L1 is yet to launch. The platform has successfully raised $7 million in funding and has demonstrated remarkable growth, accumulating over <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/mitosis#information\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$80 million</a> in Total Value Locked (TVL) in just three months. The Mitosis team has formed close partnerships with notable dApps such as Ether.fi, Symbiotic, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/mitosisorg/mitosis-hyperlane-scalable-cross-chain-liquidity-5ac22543d66c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperlane</a>.</p>\n\n<p>EOL is still in development and promises several exciting benefits to all DeFi users. Most notably, EOL aims to simplify the decision-making process for retail liquidity providers. Retail users often experience choice overload when deciding where to allocate their liquidity. EOL addresses this challenge by unifying yields across different chains, allowing users to enjoy cross-chain yields while avoiding the hassle of comparing yields across multiple networks.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"About Mitosis 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11081/content_About_Mitosis_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 704px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Ecosystem Owned Liquidity (EOL)?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EOL is the flagship product of Mitosis; it is the pooling of liquidity across individual liquidity providers in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance structure. This allows retail liquidity providers to replicate the capabilities of large financial institutions in providing institutional-level liquidity within decentralized finance (DeFi). This approach enhances the bargaining power of individual liquidity providers, allowing them to benefit from the economies of scale associated with larger liquidity pools.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users will decide the allocation and terms of the liquidity provision through public governance votes and forum discussions.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What Is Ecosystem-Owned Liquidity 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11082/content_What_Is_Ecosystem-Owned_Liquidity_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 412px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ecosystem Owned Liquidity Pools (EOL LP) are accessed through Mitosis vaults. To use the Mitosis vault, a user deposits for instance, weETH into the weETH Mitosis vault and receives miweETH in return. This miweETH provides the user with voting rights, allowing them to influence how the pooled liquidity is managed within the vault.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What Is Ecosystem-Owned Liquidity 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11083/content_What_Is_Ecosystem-Owned_Liquidity_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 788px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mitosis vaults are created through extensive forum discussions at <a href=\"https://forum.mitosis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://forum.mitosis.org/</a>. In order to be an approved Mitosis vault, Protocols must first undergo forum discussion, followed by an initiation vote. If the proposal passes the vote, the vault is officially listed and added to the Mitosis platform. The earnings of the EOL accumulate in the Mitosis Vaults. Mitosis then distributes rewards to all Mitosis LPs, regardless of the network they chose for their deposits. This approach ensures that all LPs enjoy multi-chain yield exposure.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Vault Process\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11084/content_Mitosis_Vault_Process.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 938px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Airdrop Potential</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Funding\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11085/content_Mitosis_Funding.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 855px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To bootstrap liquidity, Mitosis introduces a campaign called “Mitosis Expeditions”, giving users points for liquidity deposited into their vaults. The team <a href=\"https://docs.mitosis.org/docs/expedition/expedition-weeth/participation-benefits\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">promised</a> that “Accumulating MITO Points (weETH) grants eligibility for Mitosis governance token ($MITO) airdrops.”</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mitosis offers an appealing opportunity for airdrop farming, thanks to its broad network of partnerships. This enables users to potentially access multiple airdrops through the Mitosis platform. For example, the newly introduced ezETH Mitosis vault now allows users to simultaneously farm airdrops from Renzo Protocol, EigenLayer, Linea, and Mitosis with a single deposit.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're interested in this approach, I've detailed a similar strategy around farming the Linea airdrop for your <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-earn-the-linea-airdrop-for-h2-2024\" target=\"_blank\">reference</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Earn Mitosis Points</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of this writing, Mitosis features four live vaults. To start accruing MITO Points, you can deposit into any of these vaults. Here is a step-by-step guide for depositing into the most popular EigenLayer Ether.fi vault.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Enter the Mitosis Expedition</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visit <a href=\"https://app.mitosis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.mitosis.org/</a> and connect your wallet.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11086/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 582px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accept and sign the prompted message.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11087/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 770px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Obtain weETH on Desired Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After joining the Mitosis expedition, you’ll be prompted to deposit weETH. You can choose from one of six networks to make your deposit: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Blast, Linea, Mode, and Scroll. If you choose to deposit on Scroll, which currently offers a 1.3x multiplier on MITO Points, follow these steps to obtain weETH on Scroll using Jumper.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11088/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 777px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visit <a href=\"https://jumper.exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://jumper.exchange/</a> and connect your wallet then choose your source chain and funds you wish to swap, and select weETH on Scroll as your destination token.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Points Guide 4\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11089/content_Mitosis_Points_Guide_4.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 628px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here I’m swapping USDC.e on Arbitrum to receive weETH on Scroll.

For example, users who hold well-known NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins or reach particular milestones in Ether.fi may qualify for additional rewards.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11094/content_Mitosis_Boosters_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 532px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To claim these bonuses you must first join the official Mitosis <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/mitosis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> as the verification process is conducted there. After completing the usual Discord verifications, head to the “#role-verify” channel.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Click <strong>“Let’s Go!”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11095/content_Mitosis_Boosters_2.webp\" style=\"width: 917px; height: 551px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then <strong>“Add a New Wallet”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11096/content_Mitosis_Boosters_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 569px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Follow the provided instructions and connect your wallet to the Discord bot. Once that’s done return to the Mitosis dashboard and click <strong>“Check Eligibility”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 4\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11097/content_Mitosis_Boosters_4.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 494px;\"></div>\n\n<p>You will be redirected to authorize Mitosis to connect to your Discord account. Simply click <strong>\"Authorize\"</strong> to complete the process. If your wallet qualifies for any bonuses, you will receive the points immediately, and the community tab will update from <strong>“Info”</strong> to <strong>“Claimed”</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 5\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11098/content_Mitosis_Boosters_5.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 571px;\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Mitosis Boosters 6\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11099/content_Mitosis_Boosters_6.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 449px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Mitosis team has promised to do an airdrop, you should not rely solely on a single airdrop in your airdrop farming strategy. Mitosis presents a unique opportunity to farm multiple airdrops at once, giving you some diversification if you do this. However, as Mitosis is still a relatively new product with EOL not fully launching yet, I advise you to do your own research <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/dyor-with-crypto-fundamental-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">(DYOR)</a> before following through on this as the Mitosis vault is not immune to smart contract exploits.</p>"

By storing private keys on a secure element chip in dedicated, secure hardware, Ledger ensures that your sensitive information remains protected. As one of the most trusted solutions in the industry, Ledger’s multi-currency hardware wallets are a top choice for secure crypto management.</p>\n\n<p>Ledger currently offers three primary hardware wallet models: Ledger Stax, Ledger Flex, and the Ledger Nano range. All models are hardware wallets that enable users to send, receive, and manage their crypto assets securely using Ledger Live – plus stake crypto to earn rewards, swap crypto assets, and connect to fiat on-ramps easily. Additionally, Ledger integrates with over 50 software wallets (like the ones covered above), offering extensive compatibility.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"ledger cold wallet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/11068/content_Screenshot_2024-08-28_at_1.06.27%E2%80%AFPM.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 573px;\"></p>\n\n<p>A key security feature of Ledger wallets is its ability to perform key calculations directly on the device's secure element, ensuring that your root key never leaves the device. This approach protects against potential viruses or spyware on your computer. Moreover, Ledger requires physical confirmation for each transaction, meaning you must press a button on the device to authorize any transfer, adding an extra layer of security.</p>\n\n<p>In case of loss or theft, Ledger wallets provide a 24-word backup recovery code. This code allows users to regain access to their cryptocurrencies, ensuring that their assets remain secure even if the physical device is compromised.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Popular CoinGecko API Endpoints Used in Crypto Wallets</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After exploring the features of top-performing crypto wallets above, let's unpack how these wallets display accurate crypto market data and its commonly used API endpoints.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>1. Coins List with Market Data – <a href=\"http://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/coins/markets</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The<strong> /coins/markets </strong>endpoint is essential for retrieving comprehensive market data on specific coins or groups of coins, such as live crypto prices, market capitalization, FDV, trading volume, 24 hour price change, circulating supply, total supply, and so on. Most crypto wallets use this feature to display relevant coin information, helping users make informed decisions based on real-time market data.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The endpoint delivers detailed market information with high granularity, customizable through optional parameters. Additionally, the provided pagination options allow for efficient data management.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Coin Data by ID – <a href=\"http://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/coins/{id}</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While market data is crucial, having a detailed list that maps each coin by id, name and symbol is equally important. The <strong>/coins/{id}</strong> endpoint offers extensive data on any coin by simply passing its unique ID as a parameter. This helps users better understand the assets they are managing.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Coin Historical Chart Data by ID – <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-market-chart?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/coins/{id}/market_chart</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historical data is vital for users who want to analyze a coin's performance over time. The<strong> /coins/{id}/market_chart</strong> endpoint provides the historical chart data of a coin, including price, market cap and 24-hour volume, based on a given coin ID. Adjust to the desired data granularity with the 'days' and 'interval' query parameters.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. NFTs Collection Data by ID – <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/nfts-id?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/nfts/{id}</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For wallets that support NFTs, displaying information about specific NFTs is crucial. The <strong>/nfts/{id} </strong>endpoint allows the wallet application to retrieve comprehensive data about a particular NFT collection by passing its NFT ID as a parameter. The response will include the NFT collection name, symbol, image (as a URL), description, and market data like NFT collection floor price, market cap, 24-hour trading volume, price change percentage, the number of unique addresses, among other data.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This returned data is highly granular and can be customized with optional parameters.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. NFTs List with Market Data – <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/nfts-markets?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=top-crypto-wallets-crypto-api\" target=\"_blank\">/nfts/markets</a></strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">To retrieve extensive market data for all supported NFT collections on CoinGecko, utilize this<strong> /nfts/markets</strong> endpoint. Similar to /nfts/{ids}, the data returned will include market data like floor prices, market cap, volume, 24-hour price/volume/market cap change in percentage, and other market-related data. Developers may specify pagination values as a parameter, to manage and retrieve data more efficiently.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Scale Your Project with CoinGecko API</h2>\n\n<p>When developing a crypto wallet, it is important to focus on the availability and reliability of data displayed to the user, especially data like coin prices and other market parameters.

We’ll look at some common queries around EVM and Sei native addresses and transactions.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EVM vs. Sei Addresses</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After linking your EVM wallet via the wallet-linking portal, you receive a second address; this is a Sei native address. Your EVM address (that starts with 0x) and SEI address (that starts with Sei1) are connected to each other. During the wallet creation process, the protocol generates a native SEI address using your wallet's public key. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both addresses will still point to the same account on the Sei ledger. Depending on the application you are using, only one of the wallets will be shown, but your balances on both wallets will be the same and every transaction will be recognized. That is, if you are visiting a native Sei dApp, your Sei address will be automatically used, and your EVM address will be used to connect to EVM dApps. Both addresses can be used as the recipient address when transferring funds to your wallet.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out our article on other <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-sei-wallets?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sei Network wallets available</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EVM Transactions vs. Sei Native Transactions</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key difference between a Sei EVM transaction and a native Sei transaction is on the backend operation. From the user's perspective, both transactions feel the same. A native Sei transaction targets a Sei pre-compiled contract while an EVM transaction assumes the normal sequence of other EVM transactions. To enable users to run both transactions from their MetaMask wallet, the dApp smart contract developer will need to adjust the application to ensure that MetaMask transactions target the precompiled contract.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sei V2’s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-parallelization-parallel-execution-blockchain?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">parallelized</a> EVM adopts the smart contract execution system used by the Ethereum network to improve its performance and cost-effectiveness. The dual network architecture means that the native Sei and the EVM side of Sei Network exist as an efficiently connected system. Network users now will be able to easily alternate between both systems and access a wider range of dApps.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only meant to provide users with a guide to adding Sei Network to their MetaMask wallet, and is not intended to provide users with an exhaustive list of operations they can perform with their MetaMask wallets.

A major bottleneck for developers and application users is the availability of hardware and software computing resources: CPU and GPU power.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most of these resources are supplied by centralized corporations via cloud computing facilities; however, these tend to be more expensive, require long-term contracts, and may also have waitlists for the most popular hardware. Io.net, a Solana-based compute resource project, is focused on unlocking fair access to computing power to empower ML applications by creating a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/depin-crypto-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)</a> focusing on GPU power.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Introducing io.net</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net is a compute resource network that offers GPU power to organizations and individuals developing machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and products. According to the project, it offers developers unlimited GPU power, better pricing, and flexibility. Io.net achieves this by developing a model that allows idle GPUs to be put to good use, tapping into over one million GPUs from independent data centers, crypto miners, and other crypto projects that rent out idle GPU power like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-render-network-rndr-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Render</a>. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By leveraging a user-friendly portal for users to access this dormant GPU supply, along with rewarding GPU suppliers, io.net positions itself as a marketplace for idle GPU power. This enables it to garner more GPU power than organizations that rely on centralized self-managed data centers and facilities to provide computing power for their clients.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net cites the tremendous growth in software development, the increasing relevance of Machine Learning (ML) and AI model development, and the challenges faced by builders in this space, especially self-funded projects and projects based in certain regions. These challenges are related to accessibility, security, and affordability. By deploying its solution on the blockchain, io.net lowers the barrier for GPU suppliers and companies via a permissionless portal; and by distributing the financial load of providing GPU power to the network to the different suppliers, it reduces the overall facility cost and in turn the cost of obtaining GPU power from the network. Data from the project suggests that io.net’s pricing is at least 50% cheaper than its centralized competitors.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Team Background</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The io.net team was inspired to develop a cheaper and more accessible source of computing resources by the high prices of NVIDIA cards required to deploy their High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithm using Ray.io. Since this time, the team has rebranded from Antbit to io.net and transitioned from developing institutional-grade quantitative trading systems to developing a decentralized market for computing resources, mainly for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) model developers.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The io.net team was founded and previously led by Ahmad Shadid, former quant systems engineer at WhalesTrader and Arabfolio and volunteer contributor at Ethereum Foundation. Co-founder and former COO Tory Green has assumed leadership following Ahmad’s stepping down on June 11, 2024. Members of the project team include:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tory Green, Co-founder and CEO</strong>: Tory Green, a Stanford University graduate, is the current CEO of Io.net and former COO at Tiller Partners and HUM capital.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Basem Oubah, Co-founder and COS</strong>: Basem Oubah is an Engineering graduate from Yildiz Teknik University 2022. He is the Chief of Staff of io.net.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gaurav Sharma, CTO</strong>: Gaurav Sharma held positions at Binance, Agoda, Amazon, and eBay. He is the current Chief Technical Officer at io.net.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Garrison Yang, CMO</strong>: Garrison Yang is the Chief Marketing Officer at io.net, he held a growth leadership position at Ava Labs and advisory positions at Pulsar Games, 77-bit, and Legendary Foundry Games.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Smiral Rashinkar, VP of Engineering</strong>: Smiral Rashinkar is a machine learning engineer. He is the VP of engineering at io.net and has held engineering positions at Koo and Rivi.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Funding</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net announced that it has raised $30 million in its Series A funding program at a valuation of $1 billion. The funding round was led by Hack VC, with participation from Multicoin Capital, 6th Man Ventures, Solana Ventures, OKX Ventures, Aptos Labs, Delphi Digital, and The Sandbox. Individual angel investors in the projects include Yat Siu of Animoca Brands, Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana Labs, and Mo Shaik of Aptos Labs.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s take a closer look at how io.net works.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How io.net Works</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a nutshell, io.net offers suppliers a marketplace to rent out their idle computing resources to developers who are looking to obtain on-demand computing resources. By using the blockchain, io.net creates a transparent platform for computing power management. As io.net operates on an hourly basis, where users can book clusters for specific periods, io.net utilizes its unique Proof concept: Proof of Time-Lock, which proves that the GPUs were not accessed by any other services that would impact compute power during the time it was rented. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Work on io.net is priced according to presiding factors like workload and availability of computing resources. The facility also ranks suppliers according to their security compliance and upload/download speed, which also affects the pricing. The platform’s economy is built on the IO token. Suppliers are rewarded for works processed using the computing resources using IO tokens, while developers can also pay for resources obtained from the network with IO tokens.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net Architecture</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net is a multi-layered network, each layer plays a role in the network’s operation. These layers include;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The user interface</strong>: Suppliers, users, and node operators on the network can manage their operations via their respective user interfaces, which are designed to suit the needs of each type of user.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The security layer</strong>: The security safeguards the facility. It consists of firewall protection for network protection, user authentication services, and logging services for tracking network activities.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>API layer</strong>: The API layer enables connectivity with external platforms and some internal operations. It includes public APIs for websites and private APIs for internal operations.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Backend layer</strong>: The backend layer is the core of the network. It manages major operations like cluster/GPU operations, customer interactions, fault monitoring, analytics, billing, and resource usage.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Database layer</strong>: Consists of main storage for storing structured data and caching for storing temporary and frequently accessed data.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Message broker/task layer</strong>: Manages the task flow on the network via communication portals for suppliers and workers.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Infrastructure layer</strong>: The infrastructure layer houses the compute resources on the network. It manages deployments and task operations.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform layers are the core of the network and enable io.net’s products to function.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net Products</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let's look at the different products in the io.net lineup. Before you can access any of these products, you'll first need to create an IO ID. IO ID is the control center for the IO Ecosystem. To access io.net, you'll need an IO ID. Users will need to sign up with either Google, Apple, X, or Worldcoin and connect either a Solana or Aptos wallet for future payments and withdrawals. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">IO Worker</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IO Worker is the software node client for GPU suppliers on the IO network. It enables suppliers to set up their accounts, lend idle GPU power, and manage the resources they contribute to the network. GPU suppliers will also be able to monitor how their GPU is utilized and the earnings from these operations as well.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"IO Worker\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10954/content_unnamed_%2868%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1593px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">IO Cloud</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IO Cloud is a decentralized cloud computing facility for ML and AI model developers. It creates a connection between compute resource suppliers and developers, allowing developers to access computing resources on-demand. Here, users can monitor their jobs, including the list of workers, type of GPU/CPU used, the remaining compute hours, and more.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"IO Cloud\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10955/content_unnamed_%2869%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1151px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">IO Explorer</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IO Explorer gives the user an overview of the network, ranging from the number of verified GPUs and CPUs, the kind of chips available in the different countries, and the quantity and pricing of the chips available. It also features updates on the blocks computed, and rewards emitted. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"IO Explorer\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10956/content_unnamed_%2870%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 901px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and AI</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rising demand for AI products and the progression in the abilities of AI algorithms have caused a correspondingl rise in demand for infrastructures required to develop these products. However, io.net notes that traditional setups cannot meet up with these demands or cater to the needs of smaller developers. With its approach to sourcing compute power primarily for AI and ML model developers, it hopes to give developers who use its facility an edge. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net’s distributed computing allows AI and ML developers to run their applications across multiple cores, in parallel, leveraging diverse computing resources and optimizing the performance of their applications. Using IO-SDK, a fork of Ray.io, developers can easily employ the io.net facility to scale their operations through parallel computing. The IO-SDK is designed to be user-friendly, enabling developers to accurately use the infrastructures developed by the project.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Io.net describes itself as a cheaper, more available, scalable, and more secure option to traditional cloud computing services, especially for AI model developers who require more advanced hardware and software capabilities.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's take a look at how io.net supports different stages of AI and ML model development.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Training</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI model training is a data-intensive procedure. This is because AI models are structured for their specific operations using inferences from huge amounts of data. Io.net enables developers to parallelize this process by exporting the architecture and weights of a trained model across a network of distributed GPUs. Io.net’s parallel computing enables faster and more quality inferences and generally optimal training through the abundance of resources and batched processing across multiple cores. This is in contrast to the sequential computing model used in traditional training procedures.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tuning</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI models undergo regular modifications to adjust to newer principles or optimize performance. Refining an AI model ensures that it not only maintains peak performance but also that it aligns with the user/developers’ goals. Fine-tuning an AI model involves searching through several hyperparameter settings. Like the training procedure, this is also a data-intensive procedure and benefits from distributed computing. Io.net leverages distributed computing libraries with advanced hyperparameter tuning for this procedure. It enables developers to easily discover and use the best hyperparameter setting for the AI models.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">IO Token and Tokenomics</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/io-net\" target=\"_blank\">IO token</a> is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/spl-solana-token-standards?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">SPL</a> standard token minted on the Solana network, and also serves as the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-vs-utility-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">utility token</a> of io.net. According to the project, it is the currency of compute required to keep the facility running. While developers can pay for resources obtained from the network in USDC and other accepted tokens (including IO), GPU suppliers on the network are paid in IO tokens only. Developers paying for GPU usage with the IO token enjoy certain benefits like zero or reduced transaction fees. A 2% transaction fee is applied to payments in any other token. IO holders can also earn extra income by staking their tokens on the network’s nodes. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A total of 800 million IO tokens will be minted on the Solana network. The circulating supply at launch will be 500 million tokens. 300 million tokens will be reserved for rewards to suppliers for jobs completed using their GPU, which will be distributed hourly over the course of 20 years. About 32 million IO tokens have also been distributed to participants of the ignition rewards program and the project’s social campaigns. IO token currently trades on decentralized exchanges on the Solana blockchain and centralized exchanges like Kucoin, MEXC, and Gate exchange. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and Decentralized Computing</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s look at how io.net compares against other decentralized compute projects in the blockchain and crypto space. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net vs. Akash Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like io.net, Akash network also presents a platform for idle GPU owners to provide computational resources to users. Akash uses a reverse auction system to ensure competitive pricing, where network deployers specify their preferred price, and providers compete to fulfill the request. This lets them offer lower costs and greater choice. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Akash ecosystem is supported by validators who maintain network security and integrity by staking the network’s native token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/akash-network\" target=\"_blank\">AKT</a>. AKT is also used for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">governance</a>, as well as for facilitating lease settlements. Other whitelisted tokens can also be used, but AKT is used as a unit of measure for settlements in these currencies. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, io.net uses a specified pricing model to set the prices of resources on its network. The price paid for GPU obtained from io.net depends on the availability of GPU during that period, the workload, and also the GPU specs (this is determined by their security compliance, device specifications, and upload/download speed). Also io.net is meant specifically for AI and ML model developers. While users can be from other sectors, the facility is built on AI and ML frameworks and optimized for this sector as well.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and Render Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before Render Network announced that it would be supporting works from AI and ML model developers, Render was meant for graphics rendering works as the project’s name suggests. Like io.net, it sources GPU power by allowing device owners to join the network and allow clients to render videos and graphics using their GPU. It also operates via a general pricing model, which is similar to that used by io.net. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, Render has a multi-tier pricing structure which is based on speed, security, cost, and node reputation.

Io.net is built with AI and ML model developers in mind, the facility is optimized for their operations. On the other hand, the Render network is a multi-purpose facility, built initially to handle video rendering operations and then adjusted to support AI and ML works. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a side note, Render has also partnered with io.net, adding its network of distributed GPU suppliers to io.net. Io.net has allocated 300,000 RENDER to its Early Suppliers Incentive Program.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Our partnership with the Render Network will give us access to Render’s community of quality consumer-grade GPUs while we expand their nodes’ use cases beyond rendering to ML applications. This partnership will strengthen both of our offerings, and we look forward to work together. We are excited to launch at Breakpoint and expand to meet the needs of the incredible growth of AI and ML.“</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">— Ahmad Shadid, CEO of io.net</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Io.net and Bittensor</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittensor\" target=\"_blank\">Bittensor</a> uses a challenge-based approach to select the best resources for AI and ML developers, which is also known as “Proof of Intelligence”. Participants on the networks run a node on a subnet, and workers on the network are informed of the task while they work towards a solution. Validators review the solutions and generate a challenge to score the different miners’ solutions. This can be applied to diverse tasks like the development of an AI or ML model to solve a problem or even the provision of computing resources for AI and ML model developers. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bittensor is a diverse network and not limited to the provision of computing power. In contrast, io.net specializes in sourcing compute resources for AI and ML. The main similarity between io.net and Bittensor is their relevance in AI and ML development. The pricing structure on io.net is defined by the network for the general supplier pool; meanwhile, on Bittensor, subnet owners specify the reward structure for each task and selected participants are rewarded accordingly. However, payment for tasks performed is made using the utility tokens of the networks (IO and TAO).</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developers building Machine Learning (ML), AI models, and other advanced computing protocols will definitely benefit from readily available computing resources. This is the vision of io.net and other projects in this sector. Decentralizing such solutions using the blockchain makes for easy access for developers and easy management for providers and the general facility. It presents an avenue for proper utilization of globally available computing power by turning dormant GPUs into functional and revenue-generating assets. Even in its earliest stage, a handful of projects are already adopting io.net. As the project continues to develop, we could see even more adoption of the project or its approach to decentralizing provision and access to computing power.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having said this, note that this article only reviews io.net for educational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.

          "__text": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Impermanent Loss?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-apy-apr-and-impermanent-loss\" target=\"_blank\">Impermanent loss</a> occurs when the current value of assets in a liquidity pool is less than their value at the time of deposit. This means that you — as a liquidity provider — had incurred losses at the current price ratio of the pooled assets, compared to when you deposited tokens to the pool to provide liquidity. The term \"impermanent\" comes from the fact that these losses are unrealized and only become permanent when assets are withdrawn from the pool. Moreover, the loss will be reversed if the token prices return to their original deposit prices, and the price ratio returns to its initial value.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Calculate Impermanent Loss</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Calculating impermanent loss involves understanding how price changes affect the value of assets within the pool. For an easy and more precise calculation, you can use the CoinGecko <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/impermanent-loss-calculator\" target=\"_blank\">Impermanent Loss Calculator</a>. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Risks of Impermanent Loss</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent loss is an ever present risk when contributing to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity pools</a>, particularly for volatile assets. The degree of impermanent loss often increases with the volatility of the pooled assets. While <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/earn-passive-income-with-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">trading fees or incentives earned</a> from the liquidity pool can offset impermanent loss, they might not always fully compensate for it, especially during extreme price movements.  Liquidity providers should not consider providing liquidity as a form of passive income; rather they should be monitoring and managing their positions actively to avoid losses. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Manage Impermanent Loss</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent loss can't entirely be avoided; however, several strategies can help liquidity providers manage it. Here are some key strategies to consider.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Choose Stable Asset Pairs </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You reduce the risk of impermanent loss by providing liquidity with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-stablecoins-top-5-stablecoins-by-market-cap\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins</a> or other low-volatility assets, which are less likely to experience significant price fluctuations. For example, pairing USDC/USDT or DAI/USDC can minimize the risk of loss since these stablecoins are designed to track the value of the US dollar.  One effective strategy for managing impermanent loss, without relying on stable asset pairs, is to use correlated assets for liquidity provision. For instance, pairing stETH/ETH, this way you can enjoy the higher yields of liquidity provision in a volatile asset with lower risks of impermanent loss.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Multiple Asset Pools</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spreading your assets across multiple liquidity pools can help reduce the impact of impermanent losses. By not putting all your funds into a single pool, you curtail the overall risk to your crypto portfolio.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Use Impermanent Loss Protection</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent Loss Protection (ILP) is a feature offered by some <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) platforms to act as insurance against impermanent losses. ILP compensates you if the value of your pooled assets drops below a certain threshold due to price fluctuations. Ultimately, this protection helps mitigate the financial impact of impermanent loss. It is especially useful in volatile markets where the risk of significant price changes is higher.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Monitor Market Conditions </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stay informed about market trends and the performance of your chosen assets pools. If the market becomes particularly volatile, you can consider temporarily withdrawing your assets to avoid significant impermanent loss.</p>"

They an already existing blockchain rapidly process more transactions at a lower cost by handling operations off-chain, at the same time inheriting the security provided by the underlying Layer 1 network. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Do We Need Layer 2s?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most Layer 1 blockchains have limitations, ranging from high transaction fees, slow processing times, and limited overall efficiency. However, attempts to singlehandedly address these challenges often led to other issues, such as centralization, weakened security, and so on. This dilemma brought the innovation of Layer 2 solutions, which aim to tackle the technical constraints of parent Layer 1 networks, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a>. There are also specific decentralized applications that are very performance / blockspace intensive and want to have their own chain instead of using a shared network. Here are reasons why Layer 2 blockchains are important in the cryptocurrency space.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Scalability</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Layer 1 network, like Ethereum, can only process a limited number of transactions at a given time. However, Layer 2 networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync, enhance Ethereum’s scalability by processing transactions off-chain or through other mechanisms like rollups.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Reduced Congestion</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Layer 2 networks offer faster transaction times by handling transactions off the parent chain, rolling up a bundle of transactions into a single fraud proof that is published on the Layer 1. As more users transact on Layer 2s instead of the base Layer 1, they help minimize congestion on the Layer 1 network.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lower Transaction Costs</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Increased network traffic — especially during peak usage periods — often leads to higher transaction fees on most popular blockchains. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-2\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2 solutions</a> help to lower transaction costs by enhancing network efficiency and minimizing congestion.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> if you’re interested to find out more about Layer 2s and its latest happenings!</p>"

          "__text": "<h2>What Are Automated Market Makers (AMMs)?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AMMs are a type of protocol designed to facilitate the trading of digital assets and the setting of asset prices on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange-dex\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized exchanges</a> (DEXs). Instead of matching buyers and sellers as in traditional order books, AMMs utilize liquidity pools and mathematical algorithms for trade execution and price determination. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Do AMMs Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Typically, a market maker refers to an entity (firm or individual) who facilitates the process of liquidity provision by submitting both bid and ask orders for a specific asset on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-centralized-crypto-exchanges-cex\" target=\"_blank\">centralized exchanges</a>. Crypto market makers place orders around the prevailing market price of the token at the time, in order to increase the chances of traders’ orders being matched. These entities help maintain the efficiency and fluidity of a centralized exchange’s trading system. Now, the operation of traditional market makers forms the core of AMMs’ mechanism, except that the latter is automated and uses individual liquidity providers (LPs). Automated market makers provide liquidity through <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contracts</a> — self-executing protocols — commonly called liquidity pools. Instead of trading against counterparties, users trade against the liquidity pools — a reservoir of tokens supplied by the LPs — on AMM platforms. For example, if a DEX user wanted to exchange Ether (ETH) for Tether (USDT), they would need to find the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-trading-pairs-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\">ETH/USDT</a> liquidity pool on the automated market maker. The “market price” of the trade depends on the relative ratio of the amount of tokens within the liquidity pool. Using the earlier example, a pool with 1ETH and 3000USDT would represent an ETH price of $3,000. Trades executed on the pool would shift this ratio, representing shifts in the market price.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Benefits of Automated Market Makers</h2>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Decreased Liquidity Requirements</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary advantage of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model is its significantly lower liquidity requirements compared to traditional order book systems. AMMs can support smooth trading with just a fraction of the liquidity needed in traditional markets. This is important because as a novel industry the amount of liquidity in cryptocurrency markets is limited.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Decentralization</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Automated market makers eliminate the need for intermediaries and third-party custodians, enabling users to retain control of their assets. This aligns with the decentralized ethos of the cryptocurrency industry, ensuring a trustless and permissionless trading ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lower Entry Barrier</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In centralized trading platforms, only high-net-worth entities are able to provide liquidity through “market making.” Automated market makers, on the other hand, can accept trades and even liquidity provisioning regardless of the amount. Moreover, there are decent incentives attached to being an LP on AMMs.</p>"

          "_type": "html",
          "__text": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Total Value Locked (TVL)?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Total value locked (TVL) is a cryptocurrency metric used to measure the total value of digital assets locked or staked on a particular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform or decentralized application (dApp). These assets can include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT). TVL is usually expressed in US dollars, for easy comparisons across different blockchain platforms or protocols. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Is TVL Important?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TVL serves as a key indicator of the overall health, and popularity of a DeFi blockchain or decentralized application.  Typically, a consistently high TVL suggests a robust and stable decentralized application that has strong utility, as well as the trust and faith of its users. These factors can contribute to the overall success of the application as they attract more participants.  Conversely, a lower TVL can signal reduced capital availability, potentially resulting in less attractive conditions for participants.  TVL also helps in identifying a project’s market share, as a higher total value locked in DeFi is indicative of a project’s dominance in the space. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Is TVL Calculated?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The calculation of TVL — as the name implies —  simply involves summing up the digital assets locked in a specific protocol at a given time. These assets could range from cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, liquidity tokens, and so on. For example, a decentralized protocol with $125 million in staked ETH, $56 million in wrapped Bitcoin, and $20 million in other <a href=\"https://dev.to/envoy_/ks-what-are-ethereum-request-for-comments-erc-standards-5f80\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ERC-standard tokens</a> will have a total value locked of approximately $201 million. Several DeFi analytics platforms and data aggregator sites offer real-time TVL, and they include; <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko</a>, DeFiLlama, L2BEAT, etc. That said, it is worth noting that TVL can fluctuate with the market value of its locked assets, meaning that the total value locked on a platform may change even if no new assets are deposited or withdrawn.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Limitations of TVL</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While TVL is a widely used metric in the DeFi space, it still has its limitations. TVL provides insight into the amount of capital locked in a platform, but some components can affect its reliability and accuracy. Below are some of these problems.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Market Fluctuations</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TVL is sensitive to the market value of the underlying assets. A rise or fall in the price of cryptocurrencies like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> can significantly alter a platform's TVL, even without new deposits or withdrawals. This can give a misleading picture of the platform's growth and stability.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Manipulation</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In some cases, TVL can be artificially inflated by actors looking to attract attention to their platform. This manipulation can mislead investors into overestimating the security or popularity of a DeFi project.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Multiple Counting</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The total value locked on a chain can be overstated if the same assets are used across multiple platforms. For instance, assets staked in one protocol might be counted again if they are used as collateral in another (on the same chain), leading to inflated TVL figures.</p>"

These wallets generate seed phrases and store <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-public-and-private-keys\" target=\"_blank\">private keys online</a>. However, the fact that the private keys are stored online is also one potential risk associated with cryptocurrency hot wallets. This constant internet access makes hot wallets relatively more vulnerable to hacks and exploits than cold storage options. Despite this risk, hot wallets are an ideal storage medium for users who frequently receive and send cryptocurrencies. There are two types of hot wallets, and they include the exchange-based (custodial) wallets and software (non-custodial) wallets.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Hot Wallet vs Cold Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When deciding between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/hot-wallet-vs-cold-wallet\" target=\"_blank\">a hot wallet and a cold wallet</a>, it is essential to understand how each option fits your needs.  For instance, hot wallets are convenient for frequent transactions. They are typically software-based, and, as a result, accessible through devices like smartphones or computers, enabling the effective management of a crypto portfolio. Examples include; MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, etc. In contrast, cold wallets are hardware devices that store private keys offline, offering an increased level of security. These wallets are not connected to the internet, which curtails the risk of exploits. However, the devices do need an internet connection when funds need to be accessed. Cold wallets are ideal for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies, and they include; Trezor, Ledger, ELLIPAL, etc.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Pro Tip</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While hot wallets offer ease of access and convenience, cold wallets provide robust security for long-term asset storage. Advance users store most of their token holdings on cold wallets, and only leave certain holdings on hot wallets for trading / active use. For a balanced approach, you can also consider integrating both cold and hot wallets. Connect your cold hardware wallet, such as a Ledger, to a hot wallet. This setup requires each hot wallet transaction to be approved through your cold wallet, combining the convenience of hot wallets with the security of cold storage.</p>"

The project aims to build a platform where BTC assets can flow across blockchain networks to unify Bitcoin’s liquidity and amplify its utility. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin (BTC)</a> holders are unable to deploy their assets on other blockchains, resulting in idle BTC. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Decentralized Bitcoin Reserve is built on three pillars in order to address various aspects needed to create a comprehensive and compliant product. First is the Liquidity Consensus Network (LCN) which serves as the operational core to manage liquidity and ensure smooth cross-chain interactions. The LCN provides dynamic liquidity management by handling and managing Bitcoin within the reserve. It also supports the transfer of Bitcoin assets across different blockchain networks and integrates liquidity from diverse sources. On top of that, the LCN operates with transparent and auditable records as well as regular reporting to provide transparency and network safety. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second pillar is Solv Protocol’s implementation of UTXO-3525, a protocol that maps Bitcoin transactions to the ERC-3525 standard. This protocol enables the transfer of Bitcoin-related assets such as BTC, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-ordinals-nft?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ordinals</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Runes</a> from the Bitcoin chain to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">EVM</a>-compatible networks. By mapping these transfers, users can enjoy features like uncollateralized borrowing and enhanced liquidity for Bitcoin assets. UTXO-3525 is also meant to support the reserve’s scalability by accommodating growing demand.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Facilitating traditional finance integration via the compliance bridge is the third and final pillar of the reserve. It focuses on creating an infrastructure that encourages traditional financial institutions to participate by implementing a compliant infrastructure. This includes efforts such as the tokenization of BTC ETFs as well as comprehensive reporting and auditing capabilities that can meet the requirements of traditional finance participants. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SolvBTC is a Liquid Yield token kept in the reserves and backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. Users who participate on Solv Protocol can earn yield with SolvBTC by utilizing yield vaults or exploring DeFi opportunities. Depositing SolvBTC into Yield Vaults provides access to BTC Staking, Restaking, and Delta-Neutral Trading strategies. Meanwhile, SolvBTC can also be staked and converted into liquid staking tokens such as SolvBTC.BBN and SolvBTC.ENA. It is currently deployed on five major networks including Bitcoin mainnet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> mainnet, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/binance-smart-chain\" target=\"_blank\">BNB</a> chain. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solv Protocol has successfully raised $16 million across five funding rounds and is backed by prominent investors including Binance Labs, Blockchain Capital, Laser Digital, and more. The protocol has also undergone security audits by various firms such as Quantstamp, Certik SlowMist, Salus, and Secbit.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested users can now participate in the Solv Points system to earn points by holding SolvBTC and interacting with the SolvBTC ecosystem. Given the growing interest in deploying Bitcoin assets across other chains, now is a good time to explore the Solv Protocol ecosystem and earn points!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do take note that at the time of writing, the Solv Protocol team has not made any official announcements regarding a token launch. Therefore, participating in the Solv Points system by following the steps below does not guarantee a future token airdrop allocation. </strong></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Connect Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, head over to <a href=\"https://app.solv.finance/points\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.solv.finance/points</a> and <strong>Connect your wallet</strong> either on the main screen or in the top right corner.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Connect wallet to Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10973/content_1._Connect_wallet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 656px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a few wallet options to choose from and in this guide, we will be using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask\" target=\"_blank\">MetaMask</a>. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do make sure that whichever wallet you select has a form of BTC asset such as WBTC on Arbitrum or FBTC on Ethereum as well as enough ETH to cover gas fees.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Select wallet to connect to Solv\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10974/content_1.1_wallet_options.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 656px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Get SolvBTC</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that your wallet is connected, it is time to get some SolvBTC!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the top menu bar, head over to <strong>SolvBTC</strong> on the left.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"SolvBTC\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10975/content_2._SolvBTC.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 656px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here you can choose which network you want to deposit your BTC asset from. In this guide, we are depositing WBTC on the Arbitrum chain. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Input your deposit amount, <strong>Approve</strong> it, and <strong>Confirm</strong> the transaction in your wallet. You will then receive SolvBTC.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding SolvBTC is the easiest way to receive Solv Points and the following steps are optional for those who are not comfortable interacting with various protocols. However, do consider the amount of XP you can earn as it varies depending on each step.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Deposit BTC for SolvBTC \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10976/content_2.1_deposit.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 616px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Stake SolvBTC (Optional)</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After receiving your SolvBTC, you can proceed to stake it.

This is done without the need for staked Bitcoins to be bridged, wrapped, pegged, or held in custody. It is able to achieve this by leveraging the three unique facets of Bitcoin: its timestamping service, blockspace, and asset value. The project aims to tap into security from Bitcoin, the pioneer blockchain platform, and disperse it to various PoS ecosystems, such as Cosmos, Polygon, and Bitcoin Layer 2s.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Team and Funding</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://babylonchain.io/about\">team behind Babylon</a> features key figures and prominent scholars, including co-founders David Tse and Fisher Yu. Babylon also has a team of advisors who provide expert guidance and strategic insights. The project's ecosystem is growing through various partnerships, including Lombard, Akash Network, Binance Web3 Wallet, Injective (INJ), Cosmos Hub, and OKX Wallet. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Babylon has received strong support and funding, reflecting significant market confidence in its innovative approach. For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/07/bitcoin-project-babylon-raises-18m-to-bolster-development-of-staking-protocol/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">project raised over $18 million</a> from top investors, including Polychain Capital, Hack VC, OKX Ventures, Polygon Ventures, and so on, in December 2023. This substantial investment is directed toward developing Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol, which aims to position Bitcoin as a decentralized staking asset. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a strong team and substantial funding, Babylon appears to be well-positioned in the market focused on integrating Bitcoin's security into decentralized finance (DeFi). Its unique staking protocol aims to broaden Bitcoin's utility and strengthen the security of PoS blockchains, demonstrating the project's commitment to on-chain integrity. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Does Babylon Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned earlier, Babylon is able to secure Proof-of-Stake chains by leveraging Bitcoin's three unique facets; timestamping service, blockspace, and asset value. These elements form the core of Babylon’s security-sharing protocols, which include the Bitcoin staking protocol, the Bitcoin timestamping protocol, and the Bitcoin data availability protocol. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These protocols work in tandem to ensure that Bitcoin's robust features are effectively utilized to bolster the security and efficiency of various PoS networks. Below is a detailed explanation of these protocols and how they work.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Staking Protocol</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin holders can use Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol on PoS chains, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-appchains-application-specific-blockchains?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">app chains</a>, and applications to protect the protocols and receive rewards by staking (and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-restaking-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">restaking</a>) their BTC. Unlike the conventional staking methods, the protocol eliminates the need for the staked Bitcoins to be bridged, wrapped, or held in third-party custody. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The staking protocol has two functions, which are somewhat interwoven. Primarily, it enhances the security of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/proof-of-stake-pos\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Stake chains</a> and applications through Bitcoin staking. Additionally, it incentivizes Bitcoin holders — through rewards — to participate in Babylon’s security model. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"What is Babylon crypto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10917/content_2024-08-08_15.31.06.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://babylonlabs.io/blog/what-is-bitcoin-staking\" target=\"_blank\">Babylon</a></span></div>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the Babylon staking protocol claims that BTC deposited on the protocol are \"as safe as they can possibly be.\" For example, staked bitcoins are safe and withdrawable so long as the participant uses the protocol in good faith and does not attack the PoS chains. Moreover, Babylon claims the unbonding of the staked asset is generally safe and prompt without the need of social consensus, due to its use of the Bitcoin timestamping protocol which allows for synchronization between Bitcoin and the PoS chains.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All in all, the BTC staking protocol is designed as a modular plug-in compatible with various Proof-of-Stake chains. By integrating Bitcoin's robust security into these other blockchains, Babylon aims to expand BTC's utility beyond being merely a store of value or a medium of exchange.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Bitcoin timestamping protocol is another critical component of Babylon. This protocol operates by timestamping events of other blockchains onto the Bitcoin network, effectively borrowing BTC's security as a timestamping server. Basically, it allows any random data submitted to Babylon to obtain Bitcoin timestamps. </p>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Securing PoS chains using Bitcoin timestamping \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10916/content_HowUseCase-9eca05d99ca42eb4e0b5ee74c354176c.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 429px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://babylonlabs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Babylon</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BTC timestamping protocol is particularly useful in improving the integrity and security of PoS networks and preventing long-range attacks, which occur when a malicious validator attempts to take over a blockchain with a forked false chain. With BTC timestamps, the attacking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-fork-in-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">fork</a> will have a later BTC timestamp, which will never be chosen by anyone in a fork choice. Meanwhile, it serves as the building block of the staking protocol by establishing synchronization between Bitcoin and the PoS blockchains. This also removes the need for social consensus, as Bitcoin timestamps are objective.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, the timestamping protocol facilitates cross-chain security, fast stake unbonding, reduced cost of security, composable trust, and the bootstrapping of new chains. It achieves this by combining the short-range security of Proof-of-Stake chains with the long-range security of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/proof-of-work-pow\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Work</a> Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Bitcoin data availability protocol utilizes Bitcoin’s limited block space for vital tasks, such as providing a censorship-resistant layer for PoS chains. Bitcoin’s blockspace, known for its unparalleled security and censorship resistance, has proven to be essential in protecting the decentralized ecosystem. The data availability protocol ensures that critical data is always obtainable and secure, further enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of PoS chains.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Problems Tackled by Babylon</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using its various mechanisms, Babylon offers various solutions to challenges affecting the broader blockchain ecosystem. Some of these include;</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Establishing Protocol Security for New Chains</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New blockchain platforms tend to struggle with security issues, especially in the short period following their launch. These networks are more vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/crypto-hacks-exploits-by-year\" target=\"_blank\">exploits</a> and often require a robust security infrastructure to maintain their integrity in the beginning.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Babylon, newly-launched blockchains can leverage Bitcoin's security, improving their overall stability and reliability. For instance, Babylon’s timestamping protocol can help to secure the new blockchain networks against long-range attacks by utilizing Bitcoin’s timestamps. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Increased Capital Efficiency for Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Babylon improves capital efficiency in the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling BTC holders to stake their coins on PoS chains through the staking protocol. As already mentioned, the staking protocol removes the need for Bitcoin to be bridged, wrapped, or held by third parties, thereby maintaining liquidity. Ultimately, this broadens the use cases of Bitcoin in the ecosystem, from the security of PoS networks to earning incentives on staked BTC.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fast Unbonding</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On many staking protocols, the process of unstaking assets can be time-consuming. This can reduce the flexibility for participants, thereby discouraging them from parting with their assets. However, Babylon’s approach of using Bitcoin timestamping for synchronization between Bitcoin and PoS chains ensures that the unstaking process is fast and users can access their funds as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Partnerships and Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As earlier mentioned, Babylon has established a robust ecosystem through strategic partnerships with various prominent projects in the blockchain space. These partnerships are not only focused on the technology; they are also about a shared vision for a more secure and efficient decentralized future. Below are some of Babylon’s key partners and ecosystem components.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lombard</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of Babylon’s most significant partnerships is with Lombard, a startup also focused on integrating Bitcoin into the DeFi ecosystem. With participation from Babylon, Lombard has raised $16 million in order to explore the uncharted territory of Bitcoin restaking.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Lombard is excited to announce our $16M seed round to kick-start the Bitcoin restaking ecosystem led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/polychain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@polychain</a>!<br>\n<br>\nWith additional participation from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/babylon_chain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@babylon_chain</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daofive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@daofive</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTI_Global?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FTI_Global</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForesightVen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ForesightVen</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mirana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mirana</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xMantleEco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@0xMantleEco</a> Fund, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NomadCapital_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NomadCapital_io</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKX_Ventures?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OKX_Ventures</a>, and… <a href=\"https://t.co/QOlsrlQcz5\">pic.twitter.com/QOlsrlQcz5</a></p>\n— Lombard (@Lombard_Finance) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lombard_Finance/status/1808155649940791689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 2, 2024</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the concept of restaking was first introduced on Ethereum through <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/eigenlayer-restaking-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">EigenLayer</a>, a protocol that enables participants to restake their staked assets to secure other Ethereum applications and earn additional rewards.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Babylon collaboration will leverage Lombard’s introduction of “liquid Bitcoin” (LBTC) tokens. This LBTC token refers to a tradeable receipt for Babylon deposits that will allow users to retain liquidity over their staked BTC.</p>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Liquid Bitcoin on Lombard\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10918/content_Screen_Shot_2024-07-24_at_03.50.44.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 676px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://lombard.finance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lombard</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, LBTC can be moved freely across different blockchains, providing users with flexibility and accessibility. This cross-chain capability ensures that Bitcoin holders can take advantage of DeFi opportunities across multiple platforms. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lombard’s partnership with Babylon is part of a broader strategy to connect PoS chains with Bitcoin-backed security, offering endless DeFi opportunities to Bitcoin holders. This integration not only benefits users but also enhances the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> and security of the entire ecosystem. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Akash Network</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/akash-network\" target=\"_blank\">Akash Network</a> is a decentralized cloud infrastructure that gives users control over pricing and amenities while benefiting from efficient transactions and minimal environmental impact. The network's partnership with Babylon helps boost its security by integrating Bitcoin’s robust features into its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These security measures enable Akash to create a more secure and cost-effective way for users to record transactions and deploy workloads. The collaboration with Babylon strengthens Akash's market position by significantly enhancing security and efficiency.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Akash network\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10919/content_Screen_Shot_2024-07-24_at_03.55.03.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 676px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://akash.network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Akash</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, this partnership grants Akash Network access to Bitcoin's reliable timestamping service and source of trust. This integration prevents double-spend attacks and allows for fast stake unbonding, providing users with greater flexibility and confidence in the security of their assets. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, by leveraging Babylon’s technology, Akash can offer improved scalability, accommodating the growing demands of its user base. With advanced security measures, Akash Network aims to deliver a secure and cost-effective decentralized cloud solution, continuously pushing the boundaries in decentralized cloud computing.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cosmos Hub</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos Hub</a> is a network of independent parallel chains designed with the Cosmos software development kit (SDK). Through the Bitcoin staking protocol, Cosmos’ partnership with Babylon allows BTC holders to stake their coins to secure the Hub’s consumer chains and earn additional rewards.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Cosmos Babylon crypto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10920/content_Screen_Shot_2024-08-07_at_23.18.31.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 679px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos</a></span></div>\n\n<p>Cosmos’ blockchain ecosystem leverages Babylon’s Comet extension to enhance security aggregation to the Cosmos Hub blockchain and all consumer chains. In simpler terms, the integration of Babylon’s technology to the hubs prevents unpleasant scenarios, such as double signing.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bitcoin Layer 2s</strong></h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although Bitcoin is arguably the most secure network in the crypto space, it still has some limitations, especially when it comes to smart contract functionality and support of other digital assets. This gap has spurred the development of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-layer-2s-top-bitcoin-layer-2s?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions </a>designed to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, these L2s often depend on third-party custodians or multi-sig bridges to facilitate their operations, which contradicts Bitcoin's decentralized ethos. Ultimately, this dependency can raise concerns about security and control, as users might find it difficult to trust these intermediaries to properly manage and secure their assets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fortunately, Babylon’s BTC staking protocol addresses these challenges by allowing users to stake their BTC directly. This enhances the security of PoS networks without the need for third-party custody or wrapping. This seamless integration benefits both the Bitcoin ecosystem and PoS networks. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some Layer 2 projects have started utilizing Babylon’s Bitcoin staking protocol, including Lorenzo and Bison. Lorenzo, for example, is a BTC L2 infrastructure that focuses on yield-bearing token issuance, trading, and settlement. By leveraging Babylon’s staking protocol, Lorenzo enables native <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimistic-vs-zero-knowledge-rollups?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">rollups</a> to integrate native BTC assets and stake BTC for yield. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, Bison Network is a ZK-STARK rollup on Bitcoin that offers general programmability, allowing developers to design decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and other DeFi tools. Bison basically provides Bitcoin-native smart contract functionalities, while using Babylon’s infrastructure to enhance its transaction efficiency and overall security. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Babylon taps from Bitcoin’s security architecture to secure Proof-of-Stake blockchains while allowing BTC holders to earn yields safely. Its innovative staking protocol ensures strong security for PoS chains while giving users liquidity and control. This project spotlights the fact that Bitcoin is not only a store of value but can also be a trusted security backbone for other blockchains. With strategic partnerships like Lombard and Akash Network, Babylon continues to strengthen its ecosystem and expand its role within the decentralized finance industry.</p>"

          "__text": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Understanding Concentrated Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concentrated Liquidity pools are liquidity pools on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange-dex\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized exchanges </a>(DEX) in which you have to allocate liquidity in a custom price range. You will have full control over the price range and you can adjust it anytime at will. Concentrated Liquidity pools are more capital efficient than traditional <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi\" target=\"_blank\">“XYK” liquidity pools</a> and have the potential to generate greater yields.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Concentrated Liquidity involves providing liquidity in a defined price range and requires active monitoring.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Concentrated Liquidity pools have the potential to provide extremely high returns.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Users have to be cautious of incurring too many fees when adjusting price ranges.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Cover Page\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10988/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Cover_Page.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Is This a Concentrated Liquidity Pool?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’ve encountered terms like \"Liquidity/Price Range\", \"Liquidity Shape” or “Trading Bins” it’s likely that you’re working with a Concentrated Liquidity pool. If those terms seems confusing to you, here’s a visual representation of what a Concentrated Liquidity pool might look like on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/potential-ambient-airdrop-earn-ambient-points\" target=\"_blank\">Ambient Finance</a>:</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Example\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10989/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Example.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 423px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When providing <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> in the example above for the ETH/USDC pair within a 10% range, your liquidity will only be active and generate trading fees if the market price of Ether falls between $2,304.03 and $2,815.25. In other words, if the market price of Ether moves more than 10% in either direction (up or down), your liquidity now becomes out of range and will cease to accrue fees.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Use Concentrated Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The concept of Concentrated Liquidity was first introduced by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/uniswap-vs-trader-joe?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Uniswap V3</a> in March 2021 to tackle the capital inefficiencies inherent in traditional XYK liquidity pools. In those traditional pools, liquidity was spread uniformly across the entire price range from $0 to ∞. While this approach guaranteed liquidity at every price level regardless of market volatility, most of this liquidity went unused. With Concentrated Liquidity, liquidity providers can now focus their capital within narrower price ranges, enhancing capital efficiency and ultimately boosting their yields.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concentrated Liquidity offers liquidity providers a high degree of flexibility and control over how they choose to allocate their capital. In doing so, they can sometimes experience very lucrative yields; however, they are highly variable because the yield depends on their choice of price ranges.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, on Ambient Finance, Concentrated Liquidity yields varies based on the price ranges chosen by each liquidity provider:</p>\n\n<div><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Yield Example\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10990/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Yield_Example.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 218px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, taking a look at the classic example of XYK-pools on Syncswap, all liquidity providers receive 8.94% yields.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Yield Example 2 (XYK)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10991/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Yield_Example_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 768px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notice in the above examples, Concentrated Liquidity yields vary from 0.18% to 284.19%. This is because each liquidity position generates its own set of yield. Yield is no longer shared in a communal pool like in Syncswap’s XYK pools whereby all liquidity providers experience the same yield, 8.94%.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Cons of Concentrated Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While lucrative, Concentrated Liquidity positions require more effort to upkeep and there are multiple pitfalls that you have to watch out for.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Increased Oversight</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned above, whenever your Concentrated Liquidity goes out of range, you will no longer be accruing fees. This means that Concentrated Liquidity positions require active monitoring as compared to the more passive XYK liquidity pools.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s an example of what kind of oversight may be needed.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Cons Example\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10992/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Cons_Example.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 448px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the above example, the TIA/ETH liquidity position on Trader Joe is out of range. In order to fix this, you would have to first, remove your liquidity position, update your preferred liquidity provision range to current market prices and then redeposit the liquidity.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you don’t adjust your liquidity position when it goes out of range, you won’t generate any yield. However, be cautious, as frequently updating the price ranges of your Concentrated Liquidity positions can be expensive. Balancing between the safety of a broader price range and the higher yields from a narrower range is often a complex choice.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Potentially Higher Impermanent Loss</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Concentrated Liquidity positions, whenever your position goes out of range, your liquidity becomes entirely denominated in one asset. For instance, in the example above, a previous 50/50 split of TIA/ETH has shifted entirely to ETH due to TIA’s relative price increase compared to ETH at the time of writing.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This differs from XYK pools, where your liquidity remains partially in both assets due to the infinite price range. As a result, impermanent loss can be more pronounced in Concentrated Liquidity pools compared to XYK pools.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Are Trading Bins?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The introduction of Concentrated Liquidity leads to the creation of the now widely used term “Trading Bins”. Concentrated Liquidity divides the previously continuous spectrum of price space into discrete segments, with Trading Bins representing the nominal boundaries for liquidity positions. While some DEXs simplify this by using straightforward price ranges such as in Ambient Finance, you might still come across the term Trading Bins in certain platforms.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Meteora, you have many bin step options for any liquidity position: </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Trading Bins\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10993/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Trading_Bins.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 547px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Essentially, a larger bin step corresponds to a wider price range, whereas a smaller bin step indicates a narrower price range. The specific calculations for bin steps can vary depending on the platform.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Are Liquidity Shapes?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to Concentrated Liquidity, some DEXs, like Trader Joe, offer you the ability to choose your liquidity distribution shape, where you can allocate different amounts of tokens at diverse price points. There are various reasons for you to choose other options but in general, a uniformly distributed shape, “Spot” in this case would suit the purposes of most liquidity providers. Read <a href=\"https://support.traderjoexyz.com/en/articles/6707938-an-introduction-to-liquidity-shapes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn more about the niche cases of other liquidity shapes.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Concentrated Liquidity Shapes\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10994/content_Concentrated_Liquidity_Shapes.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 505px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why Is Shifting Price Ranges Costly?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shifting price ranges can be costly due to the accumulation of transaction and swap fees. When your position goes out of range, it becomes entirely denominated in one asset. If you then want to rebalance your position to a 50/50 asset split, you'll need to swap half of your assets before redepositing them.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s a typical process:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Remove TIA/ETH liquidity</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Swap half of the ETH to TIA</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Redeploy the liquidity</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the swap fees incurred in step 2, you may also face price <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/slippage-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">slippage</a> during steps 1 and 3, which can further increase your costs. Therefore, it’s advisable to avoid frequently shifting price ranges.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Often Should I Adjust Price Ranges?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is largely dependent on your belief of current market prices, if you believe that prices will soon revert to previous levels. You might choose not to adjust your price range, as your position could return to being within range once prices drop.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another consideration is the current yields of your liquidity position. If the yield you are able to obtain in the time before your position goes out of range is expected to be higher than the costs you incur while shifting price ranges, it may be worth it to adjust price ranges. Ultimately, some trial and error is expected here.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concentrated Liquidity has become the preferred method for liquidity pools on many popular DEXs, including Uniswap, Ambient Finance, Thruster Finance, and others. Although it can be cumbersome, the focus on capital efficiency represents a significant advancement in DeFi, positioning it as the likely future direction for the space.</p>"
