Let’s dive deeper into each.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Solana Actions</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Actions are specification-compliant APIs designed to generate transactions on the Solana blockchain, simplifying the user's transaction journey.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For instance, Actions allows to preview, sign, and send transactions in various contexts such as widgets, QR codes, buttons, or websites, making it easier for crypto users to interact and connect Solana blockchain activities. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Solana Actions\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21608/content_Screenshot_2024-11-01_at_7.02.46%E2%80%AFPM.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 422px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><a href=\"https://solana.com/solutions/actions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Image Source</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana Actions make it easy for developers to seamlessly integrate Solana's functionalities into their platforms or dApps. This functionality allows users to perform blockchain transactions directly within their familiar environment, eliminating the need to switch to external platforms or applications.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, with the help of Actions, users can request a crypto payment through text messages, buy their favorite NFTs via social media platforms, or cast their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens\" target=\"_blank\">governance</a> votes on certain community proposals through chats.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Solana Blinks</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana blockchain links, Blinks, are client applications integrated with Actions to provide simple, shareable URL links for users. These links, embedded with on-chain data, allow users to execute blockchain transactions using the link itself.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Solana Blinks\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21609/content_Screenshot_2024-11-01_at_7.09.36%E2%80%AFPM.webp\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><a href=\"https://docs.dialect.to/documentation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Image Source</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blinks can be easily integrated with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-solana-wallets\" target=\"_blank\">popular Solana non-custodial wallets</a> like Solflare, Phantom, or Backpack for secure transactions. This feature allows Solana-based activities to be executed directly from social media platforms, chat rooms, or websites without leaving for other applications.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creators can attach Solana Blinks to their online posts to collect funds for charity activities, or users can directly use the Blinks from official social media handles to buy newly introduced crypto tokens or NFTs.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Actions Work With Blinks</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The operational mechanism of Actions and Blinks allows users to perform activities on the Solana blockchain while staying on the current platform. It uses developer stacks built by <a href=\"https://www.dialect.to/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dialect</a>, a Solana-powered protocol that aims to offer the best user experience.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Actions and Blinks work based on a simple yet powerful operational principle. The Chrome extension, capable of detecting Blinks from popular platforms such as X, helps users who have added their wallet Chrome extension with supported Solana wallets can engage in activities like purchasing digital assets, token swaps, managing NFT collections, and interacting with dApps.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The simplified working process of Action using Blinks can be summed up in 8 steps: </p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>User initiates an Action:</strong> First, the user scans a valid QR code or clicks a button to begin their interaction with an Action.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Fetches information:</strong> The Action client, such as a social media platform or an application, sends a request to the Action provider to get the required metadata details about available Actions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Receives response:</strong> The Action provider sends back the requested metadata and available Actions back to the Action client.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>User chooses an Action:</strong> The user checks the available options and selects an option for the Action to perform.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Initiates next request:</strong> The Action client makes a 'POST' request with the wallet pub key from the provider, which is what the user needs to sign.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Receives transaction details:</strong> Action provider provides custom serialized signable transactions as the response to the request. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>User verifies and signs:</strong> Upon the receipt of the Solana Actions request transactions, the user signs the transaction using their wallet.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transaction sent to blockchain:</strong> Finally, the signed transaction is sent to the blockchain for final confirmation.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Sola Action execution\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21610/content_action-execution-and-lifecycle.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 652px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Image Source</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, users can add Dialect Blinks' <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dialect-blinks/mhklkgpihchphohoiopkidjnbhdoilof?pli=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome extension</a> to their browser to streamline crypto activities on X using Solana wallets like Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare. This <a href=\"https://x.com/saydialect/status/1805588183633346890\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quick-action feature</a> can be used to buy memecoins and NFTs, participate in decentralized prediction markets, and more.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Dialect Blinks\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21611/content_Screenshot_2024-11-01_at_7.17.31%E2%80%AFPM.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 548px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dialect.to/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Image Source</a></span></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How To Create Actions And Integrate Blinks</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developers can use the Solana Actions <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/actions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">software development kit (SDK)</a> to create Solana Actions with the popular open-source web development framework NextJS. Solana's <a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCht01Ycif0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> YouTube tutorials</a> provide detailed step-by-step guides and examples to help developers get started with Actions from scratch.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After creating Actions, Dialect's <a href=\"https://medium.com/dialect-labs/introducing-the-blinks-client-sdk-8bf0e3474349\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blinks Client SDK</a> allows developers to integrate Solana Blinks into dApps, social media platforms, Chrome extensions, or websites. This SDK makes it easier to build <a href=\"https://dashboard.dialect.to/actions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">custom links</a> or QR codes that guide users through specific tasks in just a few steps.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Integrating Solana Blinks into social media platforms and more\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21612/content_1*8-YqQTXghGqULA9unwvAiA.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 508px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/dialect-labs/introducing-the-blinks-client-sdk-8bf0e3474349\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Image Source</a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The developers can then test their Blinks to ensure that they perform the specific actions that were intended to trigger or automate. After the testing, changes, and optimizations can be made to make it more efficient and reliable before deploying it on the desired platforms.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Benefits Of Solana Actions And Blockchain Links</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The downsides of poor usability in web3 have been very apparent. As it exists conventionally, executing transactions on-chain requires multiple steps, with anxiety building along each step due to the rampant surge of scammers impersonating legitimate platforms. The uncertainty is very deterring for beginners.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana Actions and Blinks provide a possible solution by improving UI without compromising security.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improved User Experience </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The integration of embedded transaction features helps users interact directly from platforms while staying within the same interface or app. This rich user interface will attract more Web2 users, as platforms like X are used for activities such as the direct buying of NFTs or stablecoins.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Along with user-friendliness, Actions and Blinks also leverage Solana blockchain's high transaction speed and low fees.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">High Flexibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Actions and Blinks are not limited to payment options but also allow users to participate in numerous activities within the Solana network ecosystem. The potential use cases range from claiming a free NFT to raising huge funds for a web3 startup project.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The highly flexible nature of Actions and Blinks, in turn, helps onboard a wide range of users with diverse interests and needs.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Increased Accessibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the help of Blink's simple URLs, users can explore the services of numerous decentralized platforms and applications without installing them all on their devices. For example, users only need a Solana wallet to use Blinks to swap two tokens from supported decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The seamless accessibility will also play an important role in creating awareness among users about the latest crypto services and their benefits.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Simplified Integration</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana's developer-friendly infrastructure allows projects to create a large number of custom Blinks for their users' convenience. The availability of efficient SDKs also encourages developers to simplify complex processes into simple links and QR codes for easy user interaction.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With this simple and efficient integration, projects can reach a much larger audience for their various crypto services.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Use Cases for Solana Actions and Blinks</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Use Cases for Solana Actions and Blinks\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21613/content_What_Are_Solana_Actions_And_Blinks_%282%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The major use case possibilities with Actions and Blinks include the following: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Buying Crypto:</strong> Blinks can be used to purchase crypto assets directly from websites or platforms with the help of the user's wallet address for the current market price.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>NFT Minting:</strong> People with Solana Actions can mint NFTs from their favorite artist's social platform, like X, without the need to separately visit any NFT marketplaces. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Decentralized Fundraising:</strong> Crypto fundraising is even easier with Actions and Blinks, as users can contribute funds seamlessly and securely in just a few clicks.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Cross-Border Payments:</strong> Blinks with Solana's highly blockchain functionality allow users to send and receive low-cost cross-border payments in much shorter timeframes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Quick Token Swaps:</strong> Blinks can power faster token swaps without users directly visiting exchanges, enabling a high degree of convenience. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Crypto Staking:</strong> Through Blinks, users get the privilege to connect Solana wallet to stake their tokens to earn staking rewards using a link or QR code. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>DAO Voting:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a> can share Blinks anywhere on the internet to their members to vote for their proposals, simplifying the voting procedure. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Decentralized Prediction Market:</strong> Like interactive polls on social media platforms like X, users can now use Blinks to place their bet with crypto tokens, similar to participating in a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-prediction-markets-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">prediction market</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Mini Crypto Gaming:</strong> Blinks can help users participate in mini-games like online quizzes, puzzles, and word games to earn NFTs or tokens as gaming rewards.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Crypto Super Chats:</strong> Fans can use Blinks to send super chats to their creators by paying crypto assets from their connected blockchain wallet.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To condense everything in as few words as possible: <strong>Actions define the on-chain transaction, while Blinks provide a user-friendly way to access and execute them from anywhere.</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana Actions and Blinks undoubtedly have the potential to transform blockchain usability by making on-chain interactions virtually indistinguishable from, say, web2 social media engagement.

Creating the Solidity Contract File</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the contracts directory, create MyToken.sol for your ERC20-based token contract.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The MyToken.sol Solidity file defines a basic ERC20 token smart contract, which includes essential functionality for transferring tokens and querying balances. This simple token is suitable for learning and testing how ERC20 tokens work on the Ethereum blockchain. Let’s break down each part of this code:</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Writing the Smart Contract Code</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s a basic ERC20 token with a balanceOf &amp; transfer function for querying user balances:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/rollendxavier/641fff023aa08a254a3a7b9c5589b3b2.js\"></script>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This token contract includes the fundamental features of an ERC20 token, enabling it to track balances, perform transfers, and provide metadata. For a complete ERC20 token (suitable for mainnet), additional functions like approve, transferFrom, and allowance would be added to comply fully with the ERC20 standard.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Compiling the Smart Contract</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Compile the contract with:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>truffle compile</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Compiling the Smart Contract\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21669/content_d4af8d7f-9e96-40eb-a3f9-3d53dd5e5c57.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 403px;\"></p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Deploying the Smart Contract using Truffle</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add a migration script in migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>const MyToken = artifacts.require(\"MyToken\");</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>module.exports = function (deployer) {</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>  deployer.deploy(MyToken, 1000000); // Deploy with 1 million initial supply</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>};</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Deploy it locally:</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>truffle migrate --network development</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"truffle migrate --network development\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21670/content_9cbc0695-f4fb-4017-b114-93f3fb3f1394.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 348px;\"></p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Running Ganache CLI</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To start Ganache CLI, open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following command:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>ganache-cli</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This will start a local Ethereum blockchain on http://127.0.0.1:8545 by default.

The program defines functions to create a new Ethereum account, check <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=deploy-smart-contract-solidity-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> and ERC20 token balances, and interact with a deployed smart contract. It also fetches Ethereum market data from CoinGecko, allowing users to get <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-id-market-chart?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_content=deploy-smart-contract-solidity-guide\">historical price data</a>. The Express server sets up several API endpoints—such as /balance, /eth_balance, and /market_chart—allowing users to retrieve an ERC20 balance, Ethereum balance, and market chart data. The program runs on port 3000 and is ready for testing smart contract interactions locally through these RESTful API endpoints.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Integrating CoinGecko API with the Smart Contract</h2>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Setting Up CoinGecko API Key</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add your CoinGecko API key to a .env file in your project root:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_coingecko_api_key</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Configure dotenv to load the environment variables in your script:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>require('dotenv').config();</code></p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Expected Output</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To run the program and view the output, enter the following command in your terminal:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><code>node index.js</code></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a full understanding of the output, a screenshot of the terminal window displaying these messages and API responses as they are logged.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"node index.js - Output\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21674/content_a1af5a40-8906-4d35-b326-ff111459a5b8.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 373px;\"></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you run node index.js, the program will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Create a New Ethereum Account: </strong>A new Ethereum account is created, and its details (address and private key) are printed to the console.<br>\n\tExample Output:<br>\n\tNew Account: { privateKey: '0x...', address: '0x...' }</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Retrieve ERC20 Token Balance: </strong>It fetches the balance of the deployed ERC20 token for the created account, displaying it in the console.<br>\n\tExample Output:<br>\n\tERC20 Token Balance: 1000000</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Get ETH Balance: </strong>It checks and displays the account's ETH balance, converting it from Wei to Ether.<br>\n\tExample Output:<br>\n\tETH Balance: 0.0</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Fetch Market Data from CoinGecko: </strong>Using CoinGecko’s API, it retrieves the Ethereum price data for the past 30 days and displays it in JSON format.<br>\n\tExample Output:<br>\n\tMarket Chart Data: { prices: [...], market_caps: [...], total_volumes: [...] }</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Interact with the Smart Contract:</strong> Calls the totalSupply function (or another specified function) of your smart contract and outputs the result.<br>\n\tExample Output:<br>\n\tSmart Contract Result: 1000000</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Testing the API Endpoints</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After running the program, you can test the endpoints provided by the Express server.

I know the struggle all too well as we continue to receive airdrop after airdrop, often worth little more than dust. After investing so much time and money, it can be disheartening to end up with only a handful of tokens. It’s clear that the airdrop farming landscape is becoming increasingly saturated, making traditional methods like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> providing (LPing), <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-staking?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">staking</a>, and spamming transactions feel unrewarded.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is however, a new method of airdrop distribution on the rise that could be worth your attention, the new meta of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/airdrop-farming?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">airdrop farming</a>, Yap-To-Earn.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Yap-To-Earn?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As airdrop farming becomes more mainstream, it becomes harder for projects to distinguish between sybil airdrop farmers and genuine users. This process of filtering out sybil farmers can be difficult and costly, often leading to stricter criteria that inadvertently exclude legitimate participants.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, several projects have started to shift their focus from on-chain activity to off-chain contributions via social media platforms like Discord and X (formerly Twitter). While it's not a completely new concept—many projects have traditionally granted Discord roles to active community members, occasionally rewarding them with extra tokens—these roles were generally seen as supplementary, with primary rewards still tied to on-chain activity.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, there's a growing emphasis on identifying real users and supporters through social media interactions, rather than relying solely on mercenary airdrop farmers who invest just to withdraw tokens after an airdrop. Despite its promise, this method of airdrop distribution remains controversial. Notably, Sanctum has taken the lead in pioneering the idea of using social media contribution as a main airdrop criteria.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Yap-To-Earn Pioneer: Sanctum</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 18 July 2024, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/potential-sanctum-airdrop-sanctum-wonderland-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sanctum</a>, a Solana <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-liquid-staking-liquid-staked-derivatives-you-need-to-know?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Staking</a> protocol, allocated half of their airdrop to social media contributions through a new metric they called “Earnestness”. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"sanctum airdrop 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21677/content_sanctum_airdrop_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Source: Sanctum official blog</em></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through capital allocation, which is what users know normally as liquidity provision, over 100 thousand wallets were eligible for the airdrop. Comparatively, to judge Earnestness, the Sanctum team manually went through millions of posts across Telegram, Discord, Twitter and Youtube. In the end, only about 2000 users were eligible for this Earnest allocation. This means, an Earnest user on average received about 50 times more tokens than a regular airdrop farmer.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"sanctum airdrop 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21678/content_sanctum_airdrop_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Source: Sanctum official blog</em></p>\n\n<p>This move was highly controversial, as users pushed back on how it was unfair that their monetary contributions were valued much less than these “Yappers”. Nevertheless, it remains a fact that the yappers were more lucratively rewarded than traditional airdrop farmers in this case.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Kind of Social Media Contributions Were Rewarded?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To clarify community concerns, FP Lee from team Sanctum shared insights on measuring Earnestness in a post on X. He explained that the goal was to “reward the behavior we want to see more of”, which was learning, teaching and helping others, not airdrop farming. Active users who answered questions, assisted others, and reported spam on social media were recognized, while “yes-men” and bull posters were excluded.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">FP Lee concluded with a statement reflecting the team's philosophy on this airdrop allocation: “No airdrop is going to make everybody happy. But that's OK – we are trying our hardest to make good people happy instead”.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-theme=\"dark\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">== On the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CLOUD&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$CLOUD</a> airdrop, part 1 ==<br>\n<br>\nThere is a rot in crypto: the scams, the ponzis, the memecoin rugs.

However, given the vast number of wallets currently involved in airdrop farming, Yap-To-Earn seems to be a less competitive market to stand out in.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While it may be unrealistic to expect everyday users to receive token allocations on par with crypto influencers, the evolving landscape of airdrops suggests that “Yapping” could be a more viable option for the average airdrop farmer.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How To Yap</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is no hard and fast rule on how one should yap, but taking into account the ethos of Yap-To-Earn and FP Lee’s comments here are some general guidelines.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Be Active and Help Others on Discord</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While news and influencers dominate the X space, there is an abundance of users with general questions such as “How to do…” and “What is…”. Help these guys out, point them in the right direction, and help out wherever you can.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An example of a “Get Help” section in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-jupiter-crypto-solana\" target=\"_blank\">Jupiter</a>’s Discord.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"jupiter discord help chat\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21680/content_jupiter_discord_help_chat.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 729px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Share Thoughts and Insights on X</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Yap-To-Earn on the rise, you have even more reason to try your hand at being a crypto influencer. Don’t just bullpost, explain why some token is your favorite and explain what may go wrong too. If you’re lucky, you’ll become a crypto influencer, if not, maybe you’ll get an airdrop!</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Be Nice</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a world of rugpulls and exploits, being a generally positive person in the community seems to be valued highly. If you’re not the writer type, posting memes, jokes, vibing in the community and driving conversations may just be enough to earn you enough yapping points for an airdrop!</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While some projects have decided on Yap-To-Earn as one of their airdrop criteria, it is unclear if it will truly become a mainstream airdrop criteria. Regardless, as an airdrop farming method that generally requires no monetary investment, it can potentially be a lucrative airdrop farming strategy much like testnet airdrop farming.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Before investing in any cryptocurrency or project, always do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.</em></p>"

While Maple is focused on institutional lending and borrowing, it has also released Syrup, which aims to make consistent institutional yields available to anyone in DeFi. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Maple TVL\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21664/content_Maple_TVL.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 423px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With yield generated by Maple’s digital asset lending platform that provides fixed-rate, overcollateralized loans to institutional borrowers, lenders on Syrup and Maple enjoy consistent yield outperformance relative to leading DeFi lending protocols, such as Aave, by 5-10% APY.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://maple.finance/news/maple-2030-the-future-of-institutional-lending\" target=\"_blank\">According to Joe Flanagan</a>, co-founder of Maple Finance: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Financial markets continue this essential function, providing the capital needed for humanity’s greatest innovations—from renewable energy to artificial intelligence and space exploration. Maple builds on this tradition, using blockchain technology to modernize institutional credit, making lending faster, more transparent, and more efficient. By facilitating access to capital, Maple empowers entrepreneurs and innovators to build the future and solve the challenges that matter most.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Introduction to Maple Finance</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maple Finance was launched over three years ago, and is an institutional DeFi platform that brings the benefits of transparency and verifiability from blockchain technology to institutional lending. In this way, Maple is an established <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-real-world-assets-exploring-rwa-protocols?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">RWA</a> protocol, facilitating over $5 billion in onchain private credit.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maple’s digital asset lending platform sources yield from secured loans to institutions, and the Syrup protocol provides broader access to these institutional yield opportunities. All loans from Maple and Syrup pools are fully backed by select digital assets, which undergo rigorous risk assessment. Further, the permissioned nature of the yield source ensures both security and quality. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maple’s Blue Chip Secured lending pool provides the security of only accepting BTC and ETH <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-collateral-defi?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">collateral</a>, held in qualified custody. Maple High Yield Secured generates a higher yield by underwriting loans backed by select digital assets and reinvesting the collateral in staking and/or secured lending opportunities; Syrup yield is derived from a blend of both. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In what has been a positive year for the project, Maple Finance has <a href=\"https://dune.com/maple-finance/maple-finance\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> significant overall growth in 2024. There are 700 active institutional lenders, with 1,500% year on year growth, and half of existing Maple lenders have tripled their positions. On the borrower side, there are over 85 institutional borrowers. TVL on the platform has also grown to over $546 million, with over $5 billion in loans originated and over $61 million in interest paid to liquidity providers. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To reduce risks, Maple facilitates overcollateralized lending. If a borrower defaults, collateral assets will be <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/defi-liquidation-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidated</a> to protect the lender principal. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How Does Maple Finance Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s look at how Maple Finance works:</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lenders (Liquidity Providers)</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maple pools generate above-market yields for lenders by issuing secured loans to institutions, overcollateralized by liquid digital assets. Yield generation is enhanced through liquid and native staking, with full transparency provided to lenders. Lenders can choose the pool(s) they want to deposit capital in based on factors like historical performance and the underlying collateral.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rigorous borrower underwriting and detailed collateral analysis ensure robust risk management and capital preservation; continuous monitoring and advanced alert systems enable swift margin calls and collateral liquidation to protect lender funds. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Borrowers</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Borrowers are institutions that are looking to access liquidity from Maple’s institutional lending marketplace. Before any borrower is approved to access financing on Maple or Syrup, they must complete KYC/AML checks and go through a rigorous underwriting process. Further, before any collateral is accepted as eligible, the asset itself also goes through an in-depth approval process. Once internal approvals on the underwrite and collateral type have been met, the team sets tailored terms for the borrower. These terms include eligible collateral assets, LTV thresholds etc.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All collateral is held with institutional grade custody solutions (e.g. Anchorage, BitGo, Zodia), and Maple provides onchain addresses for lenders to verify the collateral details for each outstanding loan.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once a loan is live, internal risk assessment and active collateral management ensure there are no significant changes to borrower financial health or collateral liquidity. The Maple Direct team actively manages the health of the loan book through margin calls and liquidation levels, always set conservatively above 100% collateralization to protect lender funds. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s look at how Syrup opens up yield on Maple to the wider DeFi audience.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Syrup?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Syrup is a permissionless yield protocol powered by Maple Finance for a DeFi-native audience. By depositing funds on the protocol, users can access yield sourced from fixed-rate overcollateralized term loans to leading crypto-native institutions. As Syrup is a DeFi protocol, no KYC is required for lenders who wish to deposit funds and start earning yield. The collateral for the underlying loans is verifiable onchain in real-time using <a href=\"https://syrup.fi/details\" target=\"_blank\">the Syrup webapp</a>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Collateral for underlying loans\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21665/content_Collateral_for_underlying_loans.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 729px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to yield from depositing funds, users will also earn Drips, which are the primary mechanism for distributing ownership in the Maple ecosystem. Drips are distributed to users in Seasons. At the end of each Season, the conversion of Drips to SYRUP is announced. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users can perform actions that will increase their base rate of earning Drips rewards, such as by depositing into Syrup using one of their wallet integration partners or leveraging syrupUSDC throughout DeFi. These small actions translate directly into boosted rewards for users.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to these incentives and enhancements, depositors can also boost their Drip rewards by taking a more substantial stake in the Syrup ecosystem:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A 3-month capital commitment to the Syrup platform will earn a 1.5x multiplier on the user’s base rate.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A 6-month capital commitment would ensure a 3x multiplier on the user’s base rate.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users will be able to begin claiming their Drips rewards through the Syrup webapp starting 15 December. Drips will be convertible to SYRUP in phases, starting with Season 1, with subsequent Seasons’ Drips made available in subsequent months.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Earn Drips on Syrup\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21666/content_Earn_Drips_on_Syrup.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 796px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the SYRUP Token?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SYRUP is the token that governs the entire Maple ecosystem, across both Maple and Syrup. As mentioned above, Syrup users will earn Drips that will be converted to SYRUP token. SYRUP can also be converted to staked SYRUP (stSYRUP), enabling token holders to share in the growth of the ecosystem and earn even more rewards.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SYRUP replaces the older MPL token, and MPL holders are required to convert their tokens through the MPL-SYRUP conversion process, which is outlined in the official Syrup <a href=\"https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/syrup-token/syrup-staking\" target=\"_blank\">docs</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Migration of MPL to SYRUP &amp; Staking Rewards</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/syrup-token/syrup-staking\" target=\"_blank\">migration</a> to SYRUP is designed to enable the community to share in the growth of the Maple and Syrup ecosystem. The migration process will enable MPL holders to convert their MPL tokens to SYRUP at a ratio of 1:100.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To convert MPL to SYRUP from a wallet, users can visit <a href=\"http://syrup.fi/convert\" target=\"_blank\">Syrup.fi/convert</a> to one-click convert directly from MPL to staked SYRUP (stSYRUP). While <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-staking-explained?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">staking</a> is the default option, it is not mandatory. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users converting their MPL to SYRUP on an exchange must comply with <a href=\"https://syrup.gitbook.io/syrup/syrup-token/conversion-guide/supported-exchanges\" target=\"_blank\">each exchange’s</a> MPL to SYRUP conversion processes. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first 90 days after token launch, 5,000,000 SYRUP will be distributed to stakers, and stakers will earn ~9% APY assuming 1/4 of circulating supply is staked. The Maple protocol will distribute SYRUP rewards as a combination of scheduled increase in the SYRUP token supply and SYRUP token buybacks.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maple and Syrup bring institutional lending onchain, and make the yield available to both DeFi natives and accredited investors. Borrowers can easily access loans needed for growth, while lenders earn yield on overcollateralized loans.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an onchain loan facility, they are onboarding institutions to onchain credit markets and providing differentiated yield to the DeFi ecosystem. The Maple ecosystem has experienced significant growth in the past 12 months – a testament to the growing institutional demand for onchain credit.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Disclaimer: This article is only meant for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial or investment advice.

The rights to the object are recorded in the form of a cryptocurrency token. The procedure is applicable to both tangible and intangible assets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transition to a decentralized economy has expanded the possibilities for the application of blockchain technologies in the financial system. Currently, asset tokenization is becoming a new standard in the modern economy. It opens up additional investment opportunities for the population that does not have access to financial instruments. Asset tokenization has simplified many processes of the traditional market. It can be used to unlock illiquid assets and generate additional income by opening up reinvestment opportunities. Tokenization technology is of interest to private companies and government agencies that are looking for new opportunities to attract capital.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blockchain technology lets users break down assets, digitizing them into tokens or digital certificates (rights) of ownership that have real market value. Therefore, the process of asset tokenization is a promising solution for converting various groups of assets (rights to assets) into a unique digital representation called a “<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-coins-vs-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">token</a>”.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Asset tokenization applies to almost any object, including real assets (real estate, goods, currencies, securities, intellectual property, etc.), digital assets (management rights in DAOs, cross-chain assets, etc.) and game assets (skins or in-game currencies)</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Are RWA (Real World Assets)?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenization of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-real-world-assets-exploring-rwa-protocols?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">real assets</a> is a process that transforms traditional assets into digital ones that can be traded on a blockchain platform. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we invest in and manage assets.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Current Situation: Volume and Adoption in Crypto</h3>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"RWA TVL\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21640/content_RWA_TVL.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">According to DeFiLlama, the RWA TVL is worth over $6 billion</span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenization of real assets alone (which today is more than $867 trillion) can make the global crypto industry market a <a href=\"https://blog.chain.link/tokenized-real-world-assets/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">modern driver of economic growth</a>. According to estimates by the <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum (WEF)</a>, by 2027, up to 10% of global GDP will be associated with tokenized assets, which by that time could potentially grow to $24 trillion. Therefore, it is no coincidence that not only scientists, but also leading business structures of the global economy, such as Microsoft and Vanguard, Boston Consulting Group and ADDX, BlackRock and Deloitte, BNY Mellon and EY, have begun to actively study this new economic phenomenon.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Tokenization of global illiquid assets\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21641/content_Tokenization_of_global_illiquid_assets.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Tokenization of global illiquid assets estimated to be a $16 Trillion business opportunity by 2030 by the Boston Consulting Group and ADDX</span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to an <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/tokenized-private-credit\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global report</a>, private credit markets have been expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 17% over the past five years. Despite reaching $1.7 trillion globally, only around $500 million of private credit has been tokenized so far. This indicates significant growth potential as tokenization can improve liquidity, efficiency, and transparency within this market​</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a paper published on October 29, global consulting firm <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/press/29october2024-tokenized-funds-the-third-revolution-in-asset-management-decoded\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</a> called the tokenization of RWAs “the third revolution in asset management.” The report predicts that in just seven years, tokenized funds will be able to manage assets equivalent to 1% of global mutual fund and ETF assets, amounting to more than $600 billion by 2030. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This trend is expected to continue, especially as regulated on-chain currencies such as regulated stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) come into play. Additionally, a separate paper from State Street Global Advisors suggests that bonds, due to their structural characteristics, are likely to lead the way in the widespread adoption of tokenized real-world assets. The report highlights that the bond market is mature and well-suited for tokenization. The complexity of these instruments, the recurring nature of issuance costs, and the high competition among intermediaries contribute to rapid adoption and significant impact. Blockchain technology could play a critical role in markets that prioritize transaction speed, such as repos and swaps.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Industry analysis platform rwa.xyz noted in a post on X that it has seen an increase in the number of <a href=\"https://x.com/RWA_xyz/status/1851294707718242804\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RWA research papers</a> published by institutions and asset managers.

A case in point is HSBC Singapore, Cargill, and ING, which in May 2018 executed a real trade finance transaction on R3’s scalable blockchain platform Corda. A year later, in November 2019, HSBC Singapore <a href=\"https://www.about.hsbc.com.sg/news-and-media/hsbc-partners-with-sgx-and-temasek-to-explore-dlt-for-fixed-income\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a partnership with SGX and Temasek to begin issuing and servicing fixed income securities.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Asia-Pacific region (APAC) is expected to account for the vast majority (90%) of the 2.4 billion new users entering the global economy in 2027, with much of this growth coming from China, India, and the rest of Southeast Asia (Schwab, 2019). This is where the largest number of Internet users will live, the population will actively use cryptocurrencies and non-cash payments. Given the rapidly growing digital accessibility of the population (especially due to the increase in the number of smartphone owners) in the Asia-Pacific region, we believe that this market will have huge and unique potential for the development of asset tokenization.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2024, DeFi platform <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/10/10/ethena-picks-blackrocks-buidl-mountain-superstate-and-skys-usds-for-46m-tokenized-rwa-investment/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ethena </a>made a $46 million investment in tokenized RWA funds, targeting products like BlackRock's BUIDL and Superstate’s USTB. Meanwhile, Solana-based marketplace <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/10/29/solana-based-rwa-platform-agridex-taps-stripes-bridge-to-lower-cost-for-agricultural-trade-settlements/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AgriDex </a>partnered with Stripe’s Bridge and Circle’s USDC to reduce cross-border agricultural trade costs, lowering traditional fees from 2-4% to around 0.5%. Latin American banks like <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/10/09/latam-bank-littio-ditches-ethereum-for-avalanche-as-demand-for-rwa-vaults-grows/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Littio </a>are also adopting Avalanche’s blockchain for RWA vaults. Also the UBS Group AG, the largest Swiss financial holding company, <a href=\"https://www.finews.asia/finance/42251-ubs-asset-management-tokenization-tokenized-fund\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched </a>its first tokenized fund, the \"UBS USD Money Market Investment Fund Token,\" on Ethereum's blockchain. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is exploring asset tokenization through initiatives like Project Guardian to develop common standards for tokenized assets, while financial institutions in China are embracing digital assets by issuing fully digital structured on the blockchain – highlighting the region’s demand for asset tokenization and the increasing role of stablecoins as a cost-effective alternative to traditional banking.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Benefits of Tokenizing Real Assets</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Benefits of tokenization\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21643/content_Benefits_of_tokenization.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 794px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Benefits of tokenization. Source: Coalition Greenwich</span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenization is an innovative process today. Therefore, data on its reliability remains unverified and is not considered completely reliable. However, in essence, this technology is being developed and implemented to bring the following advantages:</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Increased Liquidity and New Investment Approaches Across Industries</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenization enables fractional ownership of assets, allowing investors to buy and sell smaller portions. This opens up opportunities for investors to diversify their portfolios and access traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or art. It lowers the barrier to entry and enhances market participation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Tokenization allows for direct investments in specific properties, bypassing the limitations of traditional real estate funds or REITs. Investors can own a fraction of a building or property, democratizing access to real estate investments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Art and Collectibles</strong>: In the art market, tokenization allows collectors to own fractional shares of valuable pieces, making high-value works accessible to more investors.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Enhanced Transparency </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blockchain-based tokenization platforms are inherently secure and transparent, enabling investors to track their investments and ownership records with confidence. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Security </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reliability of blockchain technology minimizes risks related to counterfeiting or theft of tokenized assets. All transactions are securely recorded on an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/immutability?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">immutable</a> tamper-proof ledger.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">High Operational Efficiency </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokens allow for seamless sharing of infrastructure without the need for intermediaries, significantly reducing transaction costs and complexities.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Technological Challenges and Solutions</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary challenges of asset tokenization stem from the \"blockchain trilemma,\" proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin (2014). This concept states that a blockchain can only achieve two of three key properties – decentralization, security, and scalability – at once. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While greater decentralization enhances security, it also requires more nodes, which can slow down consensus and limit scalability. Examples like Cosmos Hub and Polkadot highlight the financial and technical barriers to attacking such networks, but also the trade-offs in performance.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Modern developments are attempting to resolve these issues through methods like sidechains, rollups, and timestamping, which enable asset transfers and data exchange across multiple blockchains. However, these solutions are still vulnerable, with over $2.5 billion lost in security breaches across blockchain bridges.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To address these risks, some experts advocate for multi-chain interoperability, allowing decentralized applications to operate on multiple chains. While opinions differ, cross-chain interoperability is increasingly seen as crucial for improving tokenization efficiency and achieving broader blockchain adoption. Projects like Genesis, Guardian, and <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/payments/wallets/blockchain-onyx-asset-tokenization\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JP Morgan’s initiatives</a> exemplify these efforts, aiming to establish reliable cross-chain frameworks for asset tokenization.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also important are regulatory considerations, which vary by jurisdiction and are a significant concern. Any tokenization project must comply with local laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Comparison With NFTs: Hype or Real Utility?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While both RWAs and NFTs leverage blockchain technology, their purposes and value propositions are quite distinct. RWAs focus on tokenizing physical or financial assets like real estate, bonds, or commodities, aiming to bring liquidity, transparency, and fractional ownership to traditional investments. This provides clear, tangible utility by bridging traditional finance with blockchain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In contrast, NFTs primarily represent digital art, collectibles, and digital ownership, often with a speculative element driven by market trends. While they have utility within digital ecosystems and gaming, NFTs have faced criticism for being driven more by hype than underlying value.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike NFTs, tokenized RWAs are backed by real-world assets, ensuring their value is tied to tangible economic factors rather than market sentiment. This foundational difference positions RWAs as more stable, investment-driven opportunities, whereas NFTs cater to niche markets and cultural trends.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Key Players and Market Perspectives</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"RWA ecosystem\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21644/content_RWA_ecosystem.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">RWA ecosystem</span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several standout RWA projects are pioneering advancements in tokenizing traditional assets. These projects are leading the charge in bridging traditional finance with DeFi, each bringing unique value and fostering innovation in areas like lending, regulatory compliance, and institutional investment. Here are some of the most impactful RWA projects to watch.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>MakerDAO</strong>: With a focus on the U.S. Treasury assets, MakerDAO's high RWA revenue highlights its commitment to secure, stable investments. This approach could attract more institutional capital as it expands into traditional assets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Maple Finance</strong>: Specializing in undercollateralized RWA lending, Maple’s recent expansion into trade receivables suggests continued growth in the DeFi credit space.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Centrifuge</strong>: Known for its diverse RWA infrastructure, Centrifuge aims to broaden DeFi's appeal with institutional-grade, asset-backed pools, potentially leading to more mainstream RWA adoption.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Polymesh</strong>: Designed for regulated securities, Polymesh’s focus on compliance makes it a key player for traditional investors seeking security and transparency.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Ethena</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-ethena-ena-synthetic-dollar-usde?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ethena</a> is establishing itself with substantial investments in tokenized assets, channeling funds into secure RWA-based products. With a recent $46 million investment in BlackRock’s BUIDL and other stable, revenue-generating tokens, Ethena is positioned for growth within the RWA space, leveraging blockchain for reliable asset-backed investments.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not all RWA projects are built with their own blockchain technology, as seen with Polymesh. Many rely on established blockchain solutions. For example, Maker (MKR), Ethena, Maple (MPL), Centrifuge (CFG), LCX (LCX), and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ondo-finance-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ondo Finance (ONDO)</a> operate on Ethereum. Meanwhile, RedSwan was developed on Algorand, Juno on Cosmos, and Parcl on Solana. Investing in projects offering ready-made blockchain solutions for RWA, such as Ethereum or Solana, is less risky, as many of the projects mentioned have low capitalization and may not yet be established as reliable and proven in the market.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Market Analysis of Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL)</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"ETH Market Analysis\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21645/content_ETH_Market_Analysis.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 611px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a mid-term forecast, we should focus on the Weekly timeframe. ETHUSD is currently moving within a symmetrical triangle, squeezed between two trendlines. The price is testing the POC at the 2575 level, with the 200-MA providing support. The Momentum oscillator’s cross above the 100-line signals bullish sentiment. A potential upward move could push ETHUSD above the POC, targeting the VAH around the 3400 resistance level, aligned with the golden Fibonacci pocket. In a corrective scenario, ETHUSD may dip to the 0.318 Fibonacci before resuming its uptrend.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"SOL Market Analysis\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21646/content_SOL_Market_Analysis.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 610px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the Daily timeframe, Solana (SOL/USDT) is moving within a bullish flag pattern, currently testing the upper boundary at the 175 resistance level. A breakout above this level could initiate a rise toward the VAH zone and potentially the previous ATH at 257.70. In a correction scenario, the price may fall to the POC zone near the 0.318 Fibonacci level before resuming its upward trend.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In summary, tokenizing real-world assets is ushering in a new era of finance, where traditional assets gain enhanced liquidity, transparency, and global accessibility. As this field matures and regulatory clarity improves, RWA platforms have the potential to create a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem, benefiting both traditional and digital investors. This evolving sector is set to become a cornerstone in bridging DeFi with established finance, promising broader access and more flexible investment opportunities on a global scale.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only for informational and educational purposes and should not be taken as financial or investment advice.</p>"

Investors receive yield, usually in the form of governance tokens or additional tokens, for providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), staking tokens in a proof-of-stake (PoS) network or protocol, and lending assets in a money market protocol.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main goal of yield farming is to generate yields on otherwise static crypto holdings, and to take advantage of the high-yield opportunities available in the DeFi market. However, it comes with considerable risks, such as price volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, and impermanent loss. In this article, we will be covering how yield farming works, some examples of yield farming and how you can mitigate some of the risks.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In general, yield farming rewards are given to users who engage in actions beneficial to the protocol/blockchain. This includes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Liquidity Providers: </strong>Providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Lenders:</strong> Lending assets in money market protocols</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Stakers: </strong>Locking up specific assets (also known as staking) to secure blockchain networks.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Borrowers: </strong>Borrowers can take loans by putting up another token as collateral, where the borrowed funds can be used to farm even more yield. </p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The yield generated can be in the form of a percentage of the transaction fees generated by the underlying DeFi platforms, interest from lenders, or governance tokens via token emissions.</p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qoB5rYSePgk?si=z-j1Z7IkNlYpdyKp\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"950\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">History of Yield Farming</h3>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">DeFi Summer 2020</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yield farming became popularized as a concept in mid 2020 with many in crypto naming that time period, “DeFi Summer”. During DeFi Summer, household dApps such as Uniswap, Compound and AAVE rose to prominence. Alongside their rise to fame was the first introduction to generating passive income with crypto, a novel concept at the time. Due to its’ novelty, many dApps heavily incentivized their project with governance tokens to attract users to try their platform.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) exploding in mid 2020.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Defi tvl before 2021\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21651/content_Defi_TVL_before_2021.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 320px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Besides governance tokens, incentivization was also heavily supported by venture capital (VC) or foundation funds in programmes such as the<a href=\"https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-foundation-announces-180m-defi-incentive-program-d320fdfafff7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> $180 million Avalanche Rush</a> by the Avalanche Foundation in 2021. The heavy incentivization as well as the continued support from VCs created the notion that the yields advertised were sustainable. It was even common in this time period for borrowers in DeFi to be incentivized creating the weird scenario of users being paid to borrow. Due to this, leverage in the ecosystem grew explosively. Yields such as Terra Luna’s 20% APY on stablecoins through Anchor Protocol were seen as safe havens as DeFi TVL reached their all time highs in late 2021.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2022 Terra Luna Collapse</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) growth from inception till today.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"defi tvl from inception\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21652/content_defi_tvl_from_inception.webp\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 1200px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DeFi yield farming bubble popped in early 2022, starting with the collapse of Terra Luna, one of the largest DeFi blockchains at the time. The collapse revealed that the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/luna-foundation-guard-now-dumped-145139063.html?guccounter=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luna Foundation Guard</a>, even with its $2.4 billion of reserves in Bitcoin (the second largest holder of Bitcoin at the time) was unable to defend the peg of their stablecoin UST. This collapse which led to a market downturn exposed the fundamental flaw in DeFi and its prevailing market view on yield farming at the time, which was that incentivized yields, regardless of the backing, was unsustainable. As a result, TVL in DeFi declined as the yields toned down gradually to more sustainable levels.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2023 Airdrop Mania to Present</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With DeFi yields now at sustainable levels and governance token incentivization now uncommon, a new token distribution method became necessary for the governance tokens of many crypto projects. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism\" target=\"_blank\">Optimism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\">Arbitrum</a>, two Ethereum Layer 2s kickstarted the airdrop mania when they decided to perform a crypto airdrop to distribute and decentralize ownership of their governance token. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-airdrop-and-how-does-it-differ-from-an-ico\" target=\"_blank\">Airdrops</a> are a token distribution method first used by projects like Uniswap as an alternative to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), it allows users to receive free tokens as a gesture of appreciation for their involvement in a project.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Arbitrum and Optimism’s crypto airdrop saw thousands worth of their respective governance tokens airdropped to all manners of users who used their blockchains. For many, it was a lucrative and surprising reward. For example, simply bridging onto Arbitrum and swapping $100 worth of ETH could make a user eligible to receive hundreds of dollars in ARB tokens.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br>\nThis generated a whole new method of yield farming now known as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/airdrop-farming\" target=\"_blank\">airdrop farming</a>, a new form of yield farming where users participate in crypto projects and perform specific tasks (like transactions) to position themselves for future airdrops. Airdrop farming became extremely prevalent and by late 2023, certain projects started to introduce points programmes to track user activity and rank participants for potential airdrops. These points are somewhat similar to governance token incentives but don't guarantee that users will receive tokens. Nevertheless, yield farmers can now consider their total return as the yields they receive while yield farming in addition to potentially receiving an airdrop from a crypto project.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">How Does Yield Farming Work?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here’s a diagram of how liquidity pools work.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2316/content_1st.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a liquidity provider, you first deposit your crypto assets into liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are pools of tokens locked into a smart contract that facilitates asset trading while allowing investors to earn a return on their holdings. These pools allow traders to execute their trades in a permissionless manner on Automated Market Maker (AMM) platforms. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traders need to pay trading fees for using the liquidity pool; the fees are then divided between all liquidity providers based on the respective liquidity amount in the pool. Participants can sometimes earn the platform’s governance token as an additional incentive in certain pools. This additional reward is known as governance token emissions, which is a common method used by projects to incentivise activity and to distribute their token.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2317/content_2nd_IL.jpg\" style=\"width: 488px; height: 185px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Impermanent Loss and How Does It Impact Users?</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impermanent loss occurs when the current value of assets in a liquidity pool is less than their value at the time of deposit. This means that you — as a liquidity provider — had incurred losses at the current price ratio of the pooled assets, compared to when you deposited tokens to the pool to provide liquidity. The term \"impermanent\" comes from the fact that these losses are unrealized and only become permanent when assets are withdrawn from the pool. Moreover, the loss will be reversed if the token prices return to their original deposit prices, and the price ratio returns to its initial value.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Impermanent loss can be tricky to calculate, especially for dual-asset and multi-asset pools. To simulate impermanent loss on dual-asset pools, you can calculate it on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/yield-farming\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko’s Impermanent Loss Calculator</a>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2318/content_3rd_IL_CAL.jpg\" style=\"width: 408px; height: 498px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Difference between APY and APR</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yields in crypto are often displayed in terms of APY and APR. Here we will cover what the difference is and what it means for yield farmers.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">  <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2319/content_4TH_HIGH_APY.jpg\" style=\"width: 438px; height: 337px;\">\n</div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Annual Percentage Yield (APY) - </strong>interest rate earned with compounding interest within the year. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) -</strong> interest rate earned without compounding interest within the year. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here’s an<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/yield-farming\" target=\"_blank\"> APY calculator</a> on CoinGecko for ease and comparison.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2320/content_5TH_APY_CAL.jpg\" style=\"width: 340px; height: 435px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since APY takes compounding effects into account, it can be slightly misleading to new users as the APY figures do not reflect your actual yield in most scenarios. You could in theory achieve the advertised yield if you were to compound it manually, but this might require you to compound your yields daily in some cases. Note that this would not be feasible for most users since transaction costs could eat into your returns.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In general, yield farmers should view APR as the yields they should expect, and APY as the maximum yield they could achieve if they were to employ compounding strategies. It is generally advised to avoid compounding too often as users will incur transaction fees each time they compound their yields.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Cautionary Note on High APYs</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When there are high APYs or APRs offered, this usually means that the yield opportunity is high risk. It can signify two things – either people have no confidence in the token or that the distribution of the native token is very high (inflationary), which will dilute the token supply significantly. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">High APRs may also be reflective of the type of yields users receive. Certain projects may give out tokens as an incentive to draw users to their platform as this allows them to advertise high yields. However, such incentive tokens are usually inflationary rewards and these tokens tend to trend downwards in price. A common saying yield farmers use to describe their yield farming strategy when faced with such incentives is “farm and dump”. This saying comes from the understanding of yield farmers that these incentives are short term, and that the token price for such incentive tokens tend to perform poorly in the long run.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Leverage Yield Farming</h3>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2321/content_6TH_DEFI.jpg\" style=\"width: 518px; height: 174px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Leverage yield farming is a higher risk strategy employed by some to achieve extreme levels of yields by employing leverage, which is the borrowing of assets. This strategy is sometimes called “Looping” on some platforms.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A simple example is as follows: </p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Michael puts 100 USDC on<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound\" target=\"_blank\"> Compound</a> as collateral (earning interest + COMP tokens)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Michael borrows 70 DAI against his 100 USDC collateral (paying interest on the DAI borrowed but subsidized by COMP token rewards)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Michael trades 70 DAI for 70 USDC on a decentralized exchange and repeats Step 1. Alternatively, Michael can put the 70 DAI from Compound into<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/balancer\" target=\"_blank\"> another DeFi protocol, for example, Balancer</a>, for additional yield farming rewards.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The yield in yield farming is generated through various means:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A team incentivizing actions by distributing their native tokens (Buyers speculate on the value of the native token, thus providing value to the token)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A protocol that pays out the fees collects by providing a service (for example, swaps on decentralized exchanges)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A protocol that distributes fees obtained from other protocols (for example, Yearn Finance provides users with highest APY on the deposited cryptocurrencies by using their proprietary strategy)</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Note that this strategy is highly risky as it involves the risk of liquidity. It is only sometimes viable due to the short term incentives a project may provide, which are the COMP tokens in this case.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How To Yield Farm</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can farm liquidity as a liquidity provider, lender, or staker. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Liquidity Providing</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the primary ways to yield farm is to provide liquidity. In this example, we will explore how to do it on Raydium, a DEX on the Solana network.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://raydium.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://raydium.io/</a>\n</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Connect your wallet (Phantom in this example).</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Raydium 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21653/content_raydium_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1666px;\"></div>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Go to ‘Liquidity’ on the top header, select ‘Standard’, find the pool you wish to provide liquidity to and click ‘Deposit’.</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"raydium 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21654/content_raydium_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 645px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this example, we will explore the much simpler ‘Standard’ liquidity pools, users who wish to learn about ‘Concentrated’ liquidity pools can read our guide on this <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-concentrated-liquidity\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Fill in the desired amount of tokens and select ‘Add Liquidity’.</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"raydium 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21655/content_raydium_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 664px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the above example we are adding 0.25 SOL, note that an equivalent amount of the paired asset, USDC in this case will be matched with 0.25 SOL. Once you’ve added your liquidity, you will begin to accrue trading fees in the form of SOL and USDC so long as users trade between SOL and USDC through Raydium. The estimated APR in the last 7 days is 5%, this means if trading activity persists at the same rate in a year, you will earn about $5 in fees!</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lending Your Crypto Assets</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here we will explore how to lend your crypto assets on money market protocols (dApps to lend/borrow crypto). In this example, we will look at AAVE, one of the most popular money market dApps.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://app.aave.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.aave.com/</a> and connect your wallet.</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"aave 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21656/content_aave_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 771px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Note that AAVE is a large multi-chain dApp, this means that AAVE exists and works on multiple different blockchains. In this example we will explore how to do it on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 by Coinbase due to its low transaction costs. The process is similar on other networks as well.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Select the asset you wish to lend out and click ‘Supply’.</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"aave 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21657/content_aave_2.webp\"></div>\n\n<h4>Step 3: Enjoy the interest earned and borrow assets if you wish! (Liquidations risk apply).</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"aave 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21658/content_aave_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 659px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this scenario you will accrue 1.88% interest on ETH, accrued automatically, you can also borrow assets worth up to 80% of the assets you lent out, $23 in this case. Note that it is risky to borrow the maximum amount as you risk being liquidated (margin called) should the price of ETH drop.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Staking Crypto</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here we will explore staking, a common consensus mechanism used in blockchains (Proof of Stake). Staking your crypto involves locking up your crypto assets in order to secure a blockchain or protocol. Read our in depth explanation of this <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/proof-of-stake-pos#:~:text=What%20Is%20Proof%20of%20Stake,new%20blocks%20in%20blockchain%20networks.\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In exchange for locking up their assets, crypto stakers earn yields often in the form of the token they stake. Here’s a simple guide on how to stake TIA on the Celestia network.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://wallet.keplr.app/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://wallet.keplr.app/</a>, connect your Keplr wallet, select ‘Chains’ on the left, search for ‘Celestia’ and select the ‘Celestia’ blockchain.</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"keplr staking 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21659/content_keplr_staking_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 693px;\"></div>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Scroll down to the validators list and select a validator you wish to stake with.</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"keplr staking 2\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21660/content_keplr_staking_2.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 693px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Note that most validators charge a commission off your staking yields (not on your principal amount). This means that if you earned 1 TIA in staking rewards, the validator will take 0.05 TIA as a commission (if 5% commission is charged). This is automatically deducted and you will not see this through the UI on Keplr. Avoid validators that charge too high of a commission and also avoid validators that charge no commission fees.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Validators are essential in keeping blockchain networks secure and decentralized. Validators who charge no fees are generally seen as unsustainable and predatory. These validators may be trying to gain control over a blockchain network by driving out other validators under the pretense of being commission free and thus should be avoided.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Stake your desired amount of TIA</h4>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"keplr staking 3\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21661/content_keplr_staking_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1980px;\"></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"keplr staking 4\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21662/content_keplr_staking_4.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 725px;\"></div>\n\n<p>Once you’ve staked, you will begin to accrue an APR of 10.47% in this case (before commissions). Note that unstaking typically takes a few weeks, 21 days in TIA’s case, so if you wish to withdraw your assets you may only do so 21 days after initiating the withdrawal.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Risks of Yield Farming</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2327/content_12.jpg\" style=\"width: 438px; height: 246px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the apparent potential upside, yield farming has its risks that users need to be aware of.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Smart Contract Risk</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> Smart contracts can be vulnerable due to coding bugs. Hacks are a constant threat in DeFi.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Rug Pull Risk</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> Developers of DeFi protocols may still control admin keys. If the admin keys are compromised or if the developers are malicious,there may be a risk of the developers running away with the funds in the liquidity pools (known as Rug Pulls).</p>\n\n<h3>Impermanent Loss</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned above, this is the main risk of liquidity providing and it is the reason why liquidity providers are compensated with high yields. Liquidity providers take on the risk of impermanent loss, bearing full consequences in times of market volatility.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Liquidations Risks</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are borrowing on a lending protocol, you risk having your position liquidated when the cryptocurrency you use as collateral loses its value. You will need to monitor your collateral position closely so that your borrowing positions are not undercollateralized.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Yield Farming Considerations</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://defillama.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Defillama</a>, there are more than 1,000 DeFi protocols that have a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $1,000,000. Faced with a growing list of protocols, it can be difficult for users to figure out which protocols are safe/viable to do yield farming in. Here are some guidelines you can use to aid you in your selection process.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Total Value Locked (TVL)</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/total-value-locked\" target=\"_blank\">Total value locked (TVL)</a> is a cryptocurrency metric used to measure the total value of digital assets locked or staked on a particular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform or decentralized application (dApp). It is usually the first metric yield farmers look at to determine the reputation and size of a DeFi dApp. High TVL usually signifies a higher reputation as there are more funds at stake although that may not necessarily be true, it is a common heuristic (mental shortcut) used by yield farmers.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Security Audits</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another important factor to consider is whether the dApp has undergone <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-read-a-smart-contract-audit?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">security audits</a>. During these audits, any potential security vulnerabilities found in the smart contracts of the dApp will be flagged out. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/11-best-smart-contract-auditing-companies\" target=\"_blank\">Crypto audit firms</a> improve the security of these dApps, but it does not make dApps invulnerable to exploits and attacks. Attacks and exploits in dApps usually happen when the project introduces new features/upgrades. These new features may not have been audited by security firms yet, allowing the attack to be possible.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Source of the Yield</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the aftermath of the Terra Luna collapse (in 2021), yield sources became heavily scrutinized and projects that conduct inflationary rewards (incentive tokens) were mostly shunned afterwards. While dApps may sometimes advertise APRs that seem too good to be true, it's important to understand the source of the yield. As the yield farming saying goes, 'If you don’t know where the yield comes from, you are the yield.'</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lock-up Period</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certain yield farming strategies include staking your assets which will render your assets illiquid for a period of time. During this lock-up period, you are unable to respond to market changes which can be detrimental should there be a market downturn. Make sure you're prepared to weather the storm, so to speak, before locking up your assets in DeFi protocols.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are countless methods to deploy capital in DeFi yield farming strategies. A useful heuristic to keep in mind is that the yields you get represent the amount of risk you take. High yields can be attractive and tempting but it comes with high risks.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Before investing in any cryptocurrency or project, always do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.</em></p>"

It is currently powered by the in-game token $Fish, which is used to level up the cats, as well as CATI, which is the project’s governance and utility token that is distributed through airdrops.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Catizen is a fun and engaging cat-themed social entertainment experience on Telegram.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">It combines Web3 rewards with playful interactions and mobile payments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Catizen is a hub for Web3 activities with features like mini-apps, Launchpool, and Open Tasks.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The ecosystem supports multiple chains and platforms, emphasizing freedom of speech and privacy.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div><img alt=\"What is Catizen Telegram Game\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21639/content_What_is_Catizen_Telegram_Game_%281%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<p>I recently had the chance to explore Catizen, a unique cat-themed social entertainment experience on Telegram, and it truly stands out. Combining playful interactions with the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-ton-toncoin-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">TON Blockchain</a>, Catizen redefines the gaming bot landscape by simplifying Web3 access and streamlining mobile payments. This approach not only transforms user engagement with decentralized technologies but also caters to Telegram’s vast user base.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Catizen Telegram Game\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21626/content_Catizen_Telegram_Game.webp\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 590px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Catizen is more than a game; it's a hub for Web3 activities. With features like a mini-app center, Launchpool, and an Open Task platform, it gamifies the attention economy and leverages decentralized value realization. This creates an engaging ecosystem where users can enjoy fun and rewarding experiences.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ecosystem is prepared for broad growth, supporting multiple chains and platforms, starting with Telegram. What I found commendable is Catizen’s commitment to freedom of speech and privacy while ensuring compliance and safety in gaming. Their measures are robust, protecting the platform and its users from misuse, ensuring a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Catizen Overview and Statistics</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With over 20,000,000 monthly users, Catizen is a massive social gaming platform. It offers various mini-games and challenges tailored to the Telegram community, making it easy for users to join and participate in decentralized activities without any prior knowledge of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-blockchain?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain</a>. By simply starting a conversation with the Catizen bot on Telegram, users can begin their journey into the world of Web3 and earn rewards through gameplay.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As more and more people become interested in the world of blockchain and decentralized technologies, Catizen's user base is expected to grow even further. With its intuitive user interface and engaging gameplay, Catizen has successfully captured the attention of a vast audience, making it an ideal platform for blockchain adoption and education. Plus, the game incentivizes invitations and referrals, promoting word-of-mouth marketing and organic growth.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Is Catizen Gameplay Like?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As soon as the gameplay is launched, players are greeted with the opportunity to generate a unique cat. These cats can be combined to create upgraded versions of themselves.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"How to start playing Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21627/content_Start_playing_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 364px; height: 669px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, in this case you'd have fewer total cats but more powerful ones, with the combined features of their predecessors. To generate a cat, players can use the in-game token and as more people come into play with the cats, coins ($vKitty) are earned and can be used for the variety of in-game necessities. This creates a fun, interactive, and economically stimulating environment.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The gameplay is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to join in on the fun. Imagine a breeding game infused with the excitement of collecting rare and unique digital assets, all while earning rewards through gameplay.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Combine Cats Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21628/content_Combine_Cats_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 358px; height: 637px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After about 1 hour of gameplay, players can start to see their kitty cafe grow into a bustling hub of activity as more cats are generated and players interact with each other in the game. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Upgrade Cats Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21629/content_Upgrade_Cats_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 675px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By finding matching leveled cats, players can combine them to create higher-level cats, increasing the total amount of coins earned per second from cafe visitors.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Match cats and increase coins earned\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21630/content_Match_cats_and_increase_coins_earned.webp\" style=\"width: 370px; height: 665px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the main game of combining cats, there are also mini-games and activities within the game that players can participate in to earn even more rewards. These mini-games help break up the gameplay and keep things interesting for players. For example, <strong>Fishing</strong> let's players win more $Fish tokens which will be helpful in upgrading their cats.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Fishing on Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21631/content_Fishing_on_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 678px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, this unique and interactive gameplay experience makes Catizen a highly addictive game for players of all ages. As they continue to collect and combine cats, their collection grows in value and rarity within the game, making it even more enticing for players to keep playing. The animation of coins being collected provides a rush of excitement and satisfaction, motivating players to continue growing their kitty cafe empire.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Airdrops and Amplifiers</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To encourage players to keep combining cats and earning rewards, Catizen also offers regular airdrops as part of their game. Airdrops are essentially bonus opportunities within the game that amplifies the rate of new tokens being generated from the Kitty Cafe. Some of them are free while others require $Fish tokens. When these bonuses are paired with the 'rocket' option, players can stack up their profits and earn even more rewards.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Airdrops on Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21633/content_Airdrops_on_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 966px; height: 747px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was the most thrilling part of the game for many players as it provided a sense of excitement and unpredictability to their gameplay. The time limit of the bonus also encourages strategic thinking and decision making for players, adding another layer of engagement to the game. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you can see in the screenshot, I managed to get the amplifier up to 900% by first using some $Fish tokens on an airdrop and pairing it with another rocket boost (which was free). I was surely attentive in my attempts to upgrade to the highest level of Kitty combination before the time ran out.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Amplifiers in Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21634/content_Amplifiers_in_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 362px; height: 666px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, Citizen offers an airdrop with a uniquely cyborg looking cat.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Catizen cat airdrop\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21635/content_Catizen_cat_airdrop.webp\" style=\"width: 337px; height: 666px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It looks like I’m not eligible for the airdrop… If you’d like to discover if you’re eligible, I’d like to invite you to give the game a try!</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Beginner's Tutorial and Helpful Tips</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help new players get started, Catizen offers a beginner's tutorial that walks through the basics of gameplay through their <a href=\"https://docs.catizen.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whitepaper</a>. This guide breaks down various aspects of the Meowverse such as the CATI tokenomics, DAO, technology and more. Imagine a fun and easy-to-understand way to approach the world of Web3. Although it's not required to read the whitepaper, it's highly recommended as it provides valuable insights and knowledge on the broader mission and vision of Catizen.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, the Catizen community is always available to help and guide new players through any questions or concerns they may have. From basic gameplay mechanics to advanced strategies, the community is a great resource for players looking to improve their skills and become top Catizens.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With that being said, here are some of my personal tips for beginners:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Start with a basic cat and work your way up</strong>: While it may be tempting to jump straight into breeding rare cats, it's important to start with a more basic cat in order to understand the gameplay and mechanics. Remember that only the same level cats can be combined with each other. For example, only a level 2 cat can be combined with another level 2 cat. Knowing this fact can save you from confusion and frustration of trying to combine cats of different levels.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Turn on the auto feature</strong>: If you are manually playing the game, clicking on each individual action can become tedious and time-consuming. To save time and effort, turn on the auto feature in settings which will automate certain actions. From merging cats to collecting airdrops, the auto feature can be a great help in simplifying gameplay.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Auto feature Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21636/content_Auto_feature_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 360px; height: 651px;\"></div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Join the community</strong>: As mentioned before, the Catizen community is a valuable resource for players. Joining official social media platforms will not only give you access to tips and tricks from experienced players but also keep you updated on the latest news and events in the game. With over 2 million Twitter/X followers and counting, the Catizen community is a welcoming and active group of players. Kitty Clubs are also a great way to connect with other players and compete in events together. This can be accessed directly in the game as you progress through levels.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Kitty Club Catizen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21637/content_Kitty_Club_Catizen.webp\" style=\"width: 369px; height: 589px;\"></div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Be patient but vigilant</strong>: With more kitties in your Cafe and the higher level they are, the more coins you'll receive per second. The game enables users to generate new kitties but it costs a coin for each new cat. So, it's important to be strategic and patient with your gameplay. While it may be tempting to spend all your coins on new kitties, make sure to save enough to upgrade your existing cats and Cafe.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Click on the rare and unique characters</strong>: Occasionally, you might see a non-human character walking around your Cafe. These characters are special and can give you extra bonuses or rewards when clicked on. So keep an eye out for them, they might just give you a boost in your gameplay.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Experiment and have fun</strong>: At the end of the day,  this game is meant to be enjoyed. Don't be afraid to experiment with trying out new strategies. With each cat being unique and having its own traits, there is no right or wrong way to play the game. So embrace your inner Catizen and have fun.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Understanding CATI Tokenomics</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/catizen\" target=\"_blank\">CATI</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-ton-wallets-jettons-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">JETTON</a> will serve as the governance and utility token for Catizen. By staking their CATI tokens, engaging in games, and participating in essential governance votes, holders can earn rewards such as Third Party’s Utility Tokens or in-game virtual rewards via Launchpool and the Task Center. In the game, $vKitty serves as the primary currency mined with the help of kitties. By crossing kitties, players can enhance their levels and increase the number of tokens earned. Token $Fish is a premium currency that allows you to purchase boosts and high-level kitties.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you can see, the economics of Catizen’s tokens, which are designed to reward players for their participation and give them the opportunity to earn valuable rewards. It's important to understand these tokenomics in order to strategize and make the most out of your gameplay.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The total supply of CATI tokens is 1 billion, with 43% being allocated towards airdrops and the ecosystem. This helps to ensure a fair distribution of the tokens and creates opportunities for players to earn rewards through various activities. With this abundant supply, players have ample opportunities to earn and use CATI tokens within the game.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CATI tokens aren't earned directly through gameplay. Rather, they are distributed during airdrop events, rewarding players based on their contributions to the in-game ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contributions encompass user activity levels, aiding in the assessment of authenticity and reliability. Key criteria such as the frequency of on-chain interactions, in-game social behavior, and daily task completion help verify the authenticity of genuine users.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Overview of In-Game Mechanics</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary factors influencing game scores are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">$vKitty Coin Earnings: As players nurture higher-level cats, they earn more $vKitty Coins, necessitating greater effort and care.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">$Fish Utilization: Purchasing and using $Fish can rapidly boost a player's earnings, enabling significant gains in a short period.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">wCATI: This exclusive gift, available only to participants of the 1st Catizen Launchpool, will not be issued again. wCATI holders will receive additional Catizen Airdrop shares.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">xZEN: This special reward is granted to those who complete assists and engage in on-chain interactions in Catizen, embodying the community spirit of our airdrop.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Players can also buy these tokens directly from the shop, to increase the growth rate of their virtual cats and accelerate their progress in the game. Another option is to 'earn' these rewards by completing daily challenges such as inviting new players, joining community events, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Why Use a Telegram Bot For The Game?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a unique approach to player engagement, Catizen utilizes a Telegram bot for various in-game activities and communication. Some of the reasons why theywe chose to integrate a Telegram bot into theirour game are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Convenient access</strong>: Telegram is widely used across various platforms and devices, making it easily accessible to players from different regions and backgrounds. This convenience allows for a broader reach and greater engagement.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Real-time interaction</strong>: The Telegram bot enables real-time interaction between players, allowing them to form communities, engage in discussions, and exchange tips and strategies. This creates a more immersive experience for players and fosters a sense of community within the game.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Instant notifications</strong>: With the help of Telegram notifications, players can stay updated on important events and announcements related to the game. This ensures that players don't miss out on any opportunities or rewards.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>User-friendly interface</strong>: The Telegram bot provides a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use, making it accessible to players of all ages and technological backgrounds. This simplicity encourages more players to participate in the game.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Web3 friendly chat app, Telegram further aligns with Catizen's decentralized and community-focused approach. By utilizing a Telegram bot for their game, Catizen provides a unique and engaging experience for players, promoting an active and inclusive gaming community. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Next Level: Upcoming Developments and Expectations</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Web3 based game doesn't quite have an end like many other traditional games.

This transformative phase within the Bitcoin ecosystem is meant to scale Bitcoin by embracing technological advancements and exploring practical applications. One emerging protocol in Bitcoin Season 2 is Nubit, a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/data-availability-blockchain-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">data availability</a> layer for the <a href=\"http://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/bitcoin-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin ecosystem</a> that is designed to enable secure storage and data retrieval without putting additional strain on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Projects commonly face space constraints and high costs when attempting to use Bitcoin’s block space to secure their blockchains. Nubit aims to address these challenges by leveraging Bitcoin’s economic security and optimizing key metrics including fraud detection mechanisms, attestation security, and accessibility with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-proofs-and-zk-rollups?locale=en\">zero knowledge</a> technology. The end result is Bitcoin-level security for applications and infrastructures to take advantage of. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through this, Nubit is able to bridge the gap between Bitcoin-native solutions and the broader multi-chain ecosystem. The protocol has also integrated with other major players such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-babylon-crypto-bitcoin-staking?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Babylon</a>, Merlin Chain, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bouncebit\" target=\"_blank\">BounceBit</a> to further enhance data availability and network scalability. On top of that, Nubit is developing a programmable, modular, and trustless execution layer for meta-protocols such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/brc-20-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">BRC-20</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes\" target=\"_blank\">Runes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Nubit is able to fully inherit Bitcoin’s security through the implementation of Bitcoin’s native staking and Bitcoin anchoring methods. The Bitcoin staking approach allows for Bitcoin owners to participate in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/proof-of-stake-pos?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> blockchains directly without the need for third-party services. This allows for stronger economic security measures while improving liquidity for stakers. At the same time, Bitcoin anchoring allows users to quickly unbond staked assets while mitigating possible attacks by implementing checkpoints to invalidate any <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-fork-in-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">forks</a> that originate before them.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nubit was founded by UCSB computer science professor Yu Feng, and launched by Riema Labs, a project led by academic blockchain security experts. Riema Labs aims to revolutionize Bitcoin’s usability and security. At the time of writing, Nubit is the only project under the Riema Labs portfolio. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On January 4, 2024, Riema Labs announced the conclusion of its angel investment round with an undisclosed amount for the launch of Nubit. Since then, Nubit raised $3 million in pre-seed funding on March 26, 2024, which attracted investors such as dao5, OKX Ventures, and Primitive Ventures. More recently, the protocol successfully closed an $8 million seed funding round led by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-venture-capital-vc-firms-crypto-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Polychain Capital</a>, with participation from Nomad Capital, Spartan Group, Gate Ventures, Animoca, and others. </p>\n\n<p>Nubit announced the launch of the Nubit Alpha Testnet Incentivized Campaign on June 8, 2024. The campaign aims to encourage interested users to explore and interact with the Nubit Testnet. It is divided into three phases which are referred to as Community Assemble, Light Node Quest, and Testnet Adventure. The Nubit Alpha Testnet is currently in Phase 3, Testnet Adventure, which will let users experience activities through consumer applications. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>However, do take note that at the time of writing, the Nubit team has not made any official announcements regarding a token launch or airdrop campaign. Therefore, following the steps below and participating in the Nubit Alpha Testnet Incentivized Campaign Phase 3 does not guarantee a future token airdrop allocation.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Connect Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Go to <a href=\"https://alpha.nubit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://alpha.nubit.org/</a> and <strong>Connect Wallet</strong>. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Connect Wallet to Nubit\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21520/content_1._Connect_wallet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 646px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are currently only two wallet options, Keplr and Tomo. Select whichever wallet you want to use. In this guide, we are using the Keplr wallet. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Select wallet to connect to Nubit\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21521/content_1.1_Select_wallet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 581px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Earn Points</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After connecting your wallet, scroll down to <strong>Phase 1 Community Assemble</strong> where you can complete three tasks to earn points. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, you will need a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/galxe-gal?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Galxe</a> account to complete these steps. Click on the first task to be redirected to the Galxe campaign page.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Earn points on Nubit Phase 1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21522/content_2._Phase_1.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 652px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have logged in to your Galxe account, proceed to complete the three tasks. Click on each task to be redirected to the intended page. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Complete Nubit tasks on Galxe\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21523/content_2.1_Galxe.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Back on the Nubit Alpha Testnet main page, you will start earning the points corresponding to the completed tasks. For example, in the image below, we have earned 1,000 points from following Nubit on X (formerly Twitter). </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If your points are not appearing, you can either <strong>Verify</strong> your Galxe account or refresh the page. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Verify Galxe account to view Nubit points\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21524/content_2.3_Points.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 684px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Interact with the Applications</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can then move on to <strong>Phase 3 Testnet Adventure</strong> since Phase 2 closed until further notice. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Click on <strong>Log in with Telegram</strong> to open your Telegram application and connect your account.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Start Nubit Testnet Adventure with Telegram\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21525/content_3._Phase_3.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 652px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Connecting the Nubit Alpha Testnet to your Telegram will give it access to your Name, Username, and Profile Picture.

When the LIVE phase starts, you can no longer make predictions. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the countdown timer ends, you will get your results. If your prediction is correct then you will win more points based on a multiplier but if you are incorrect, you will lose points.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"BTC Price Fluctuation Prediction Game NubeeBot\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21530/content_3.6_Play.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 894px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second game is Crossy Block brought by Suzume Games. Similarly to the NubeeBot, clicking <strong>Play</strong> will open the Suzume Games Telegram bot.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Suzume Games Telegram earn Nubit points\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21531/content_3.6_Crossy_block.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 660px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After clicking <strong>Start</strong>, you can <strong>Open SUZUME</strong> to open the Telegram mini application.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Open Suzume games\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21532/content_3.8_open.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 871px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of your first interaction with Suzume Games, you can claim welcome gifts. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Claim Suzume gifts\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21533/content_3.9_claim_gifts.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 890px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then select to <strong>Play</strong> Crossy Block. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Play Crossy Block\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21534/content_3.10_play.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 890px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Crossy Block, the aim of the game is to build a bridge long enough to connect two towers for your character to walk across.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Play Crossy Block on Telegram earn Nubit points\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21535/content_3.11_crossy_block.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 931px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To build your bridge, tap and hold until it looks like it can reach across. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Build bridge on Crossy Block\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21536/content_3.12_play.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 931px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For both Nubee and Crossy Block, you might encounter issues opening the games on one device. We recommend switching between devices that your Telegram is logged into such as a desktop or mobile device.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nubit is an emerging player in Bitcoin Season 2 by acting as a data availability layer for the Bitcoin ecosystem. This allows for applications to access the security of Bitcoin without adding more strain on the blockchain. Users can now participate in the Nubit Alpha Testnet Incentivized Campaign to earn points. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.

					"__text": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Securing cryptocurrency has never been more important, especially with the rise of hacks and security incidents. One of the best ways to store cryptocurrencies is to use a cold hardware wallet, which is exactly what the <a href=\"https://gcko.io/trezor-safe5\">Trezor Safe 5</a> is. In this review, we cover all there is to know about the Safe 5.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Features Overview &amp; Unboxing</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Trezor Safe 5 is a cold hardware wallet marketed as the successor to the Model T. Its features include a 1.54-inch colored touchscreen safeguarded by a Secure Element EAL6+ chip, a microSD card slot, and the ability to store over 7,000 different cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>Moving to the unboxing, the box contains the Trezor Safe 5 wallet, a USB-C to USB-C cable, 2x 20-word wallet backup cards, Trezor stickers, and a start-up guide. The box itself has been thoughtfully designed, with prompts printed on the packaging to guide you through the setup process.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21616/content_Trezor_Unboxing-1.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 956px;\"></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21617/content_Trezor_Unboxing.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 956px;\"></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">\n<img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21618/content_trezor-thoughtful-packaging.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 956px;\"><br>\n<br>\n </h2>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Design &amp; Build Quality: Sleek &amp; Stylish</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Trezor Safe 5 inherits a similar form factor from its predecessors, but the similarities stop there. Up front, it packs a <strong>1.54-inch colored touchscreen protected by scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3</strong> (the same type of glass found on most smartphones). It also utilizes haptic feedback to improve the user experience and make it feel more like using a smartphone. </p>\n\n<p>The new display and haptic feedback make it user-friendly. Users no longer need to navigate with two physical buttons. Instead, the touchscreen is large enough to easily key in PINs or read and approve transactions. <strong>Using the touchscreen was a breeze and felt comparable to typing on a smartphone</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the exterior is built from PC-ABS plastic, with an anodized aluminum backplate. Coupled with the new display, the Safe 5 looks sleek, stylish, and premium. </p>\n\n<p>My only gripe with the Safe 5's design is the ‘VOID’ sticker imprint left on the device once the tamper-proof sticker is removed. While this is a safety feature to ensure the device isn’t tampered with before it reaches customers, unfortunately, it does ruin the sleek look. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Security: EAL 6+ &amp; Tamper Proof</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Trezor Safe 5 uses NDA-free EAL 6+ Secure Element for protection. This means that <strong>Trezor signed an NDA-free agreement with the chip manufacturer, allowing them to maintain transparency and update their users on any issues that arise with the hardware</strong>. In addition, Trezor only uses public, open-source code designs, so users can verify the integrity of any wallets created by the company.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the EAL 6+ Secure Element refers to a specific type of security chip that has achieved Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (CC EAL) 6+ certification. It is part of an internationally recognized standard for evaluating the security of IT products and systems. Such chips are <strong>commonly used to guard data in cards and passports by preventing brute-force attacks</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As an additional security measure, the Safe 5 allows users to <strong>encrypt the PIN with a microSD card</strong>. With this feature, a randomly generated secret is stored on the microSD card, which must also be inserted into the device to unlock the hardware wallet. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">20-word wallet backup</h3>\n\n<p>Trezor has implemented a <strong>new 20-word wallet backup standard (<a href=\"https://content.trezor.io/slip39\">SLIP-39</a>) for its latest wallets</strong>. The words in the recovery phrase are optimized for entry on a Trezor keyboard and allow for a seamless upgrade to Multi-share Backup in the Trezor Suite. However, it is still possible to use the previous BIP-39 standard where you can choose either a 12-word or 24-word backup. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Assets Supported: Vast but lacks Solana</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the ability to launch coins at the tip of everyone’s finger, the market is flooded with thousands of new coins daily. Trezor mentioned that the <strong>Safe 5 is able to support over 7,000 assets</strong>, from blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (including ERC-20 tokens), Cardano, Ripple, Dogecoin, Solana, and more. </p>\n\n<p>While users should have no issue interacting with the vast majority of tokens from various networks via Trezor Suite, <strong>SPL tokens on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana\">Solana</a> aren’t yet supported</strong>. To access SPL Tokens, users will need to connect to NuFi, a third-party Web3 wallet. Popular Solana SPL wallets, such as Phantom and Solflare, aren’t supported at the time of writing. With that being said, it is perfectly fine to send any SPL Tokens to the Safe 5, but they will not be visible on the Trezor Suite. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Trezor Suite</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Trezor Suite allows users to manage their digital assets by buying, selling, sending, and receiving tokens. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you own the latest Trezor Safe 5 or the Model One, you will have access to the same Trezor Suite. The interface is clean and easy to navigate. Simply plug in your Trezor device, key in your PIN, and you will have access to your assets. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Adding Accounts</h3>\n\n<p>Adding various networks or new addresses is pretty straightforward. Simply select the “+” icon, which will show the various network options. Choose which coin to activate, and it will be set up. </p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21619/content_Activate_New_Coins_Trezor.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 572px;\"></p>\n\n<p>However, if you would like to add a new address, the current address needs to hold a balance before a new one can be created. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Performing Transactions</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Performing transactions through the Trezor Suite is rather simple. Simply click on the Account you would like to use, followed by the “Send” or “Receive” icons. If you’re sending crypto, key-in an address, followed by “Review &amp; Send”. You will then be prompted to check and confirm the transaction on your Trezor device. </p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21620/content_Sending_Transaction_Trezor__1.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 230px;\"></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21621/content_Sending_Transaction_Trezor.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 603px;\"></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As for receiving crypto, click on “Show full address” and check if the address matches the one shown on the Trezor wallet. If it does, tap to confirm, and you’ll be allowed to copy the address.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21622/content_Receiving_Trezor__1.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 303px;\"></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21623/content_Receiving_Trezor__2.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 545px;\"></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">ETH Staking Now Supported</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21624/content_ETH_Staking.webp\" style=\"width: 720px; height: 434px;\"></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-staking\">Ethereum (ETH) staking</a> is now supported through the Trezor Suite. Trezor has partnered with Everstake, a staking provider, to offer this service. While it’s convenient to do it directly from the Suite, a 10% fee on rewards is charged for this service. However, do note that when your ETH is staked, your assets are managed by Everstake as the funds are sent to a smart contract owned by them. This is a similar process to staking your ETH with other staking providers. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Trezor Expert</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Trezor Expert is a $99, 60-minute 1:1 guide for setting up Trezor hardware wallets. It is currently available for all Trezor hardware wallets. Here’s how it goes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Purchase a Trezor hardware wallet and a Trezor Expert session</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Once you’ve received the wallet, you can book a time slot through your order confirmation email. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In the session, you will be asked to unbox the device (if you haven’t already), and a quick presentation covering crypto and wallets will be given.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Expert will then walk you through the Trezor Suite installation. During this session, you will be required to share your screen so that they can point out certain elements of the desktop app. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Next will be the wallet setup. During this part of the session, you will have to stop screen-sharing. The Expert checks whether you’re alone and ensures your webcam is turned off and the mic is muted. This is when you will be required to write down your seed phrase (which is not to be shared with anyone) and set up a PIN. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Once you have done this, the Expert will walk you through the Trezor Suite functionalities and teach you how to perform a backup check. </p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We sat through a session, and the Expert was very thorough, walking us through each step of the setup and answering any questions we had. While the Trezor Expert is not needed if you have past experience with hardware wallets, it is definitely a <strong>useful service for first-time owners</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pros: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Very intuitive design and interface, making it easy to use even for newbies</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Large color touchscreen</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EAL 6+ Secure Element </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A multitude of assets supported natively</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">SPL Tokens on Solana are not supported at the moment and can only be accessed via a third-party wallet</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Expensive at $169</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Trezor Safe 5 is an excellent hardware wallet, whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned holder. Its simplistic and intuitive UI makes navigation a breeze, and the vast number of assets supported allows the majority of crypto holders to use this wallet. However, it is best for long-term crypto holdings (as a cold wallet should be) rather than for meme coins or frequent trading, as approving transactions can take time.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the downside, SPL Tokens on Solana aren’t supported at the moment and can only be accessed via third-party wallets. The Safe 5 is also relatively expensive, especially if it’s your first crypto wallet. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to pick one up for yourself, check it out <a href=\"https://gcko.io/trezor-safe5\">here</a>!</p>"

These narratives can influence investor sentiment, market trends, and the adoption of new technologies. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Narratives in cryptocurrency refer to the trending ideas, stories, or beliefs that shape how people perceive and value cryptocurrencies – they can influence investor sentiment, market trends, and the adoption of new technologies. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">One of the biggest trends in 2024 is the focus on accessibility, where anyone can participate without requiring extensive crypto and blockchain knowledge, as seen in the popularity of memecoins and prediction markets. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Memecoins, liquid restaking tokens, liquid staking derivatives, blockchain modularity, Layer 1s, Layer 2s (Optimistic rollups and zero knowledge rollups), BRC-20, DePIN, Telegram crypto trading bots, prediction markets, and RWAs are some narratives to watch in 2024.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Crypto narratives can also be misleading or even harmful based on false assumptions or hype. Therefore, it's important to critically evaluate narratives and base your investment decisions on sound analysis and research.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What is a narrative in crypto\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9155/content_Crypto_Narratives.webp\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 475px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article was updated in January 2024 to reflect new and upcoming narratives by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/author/coingecko\" target=\"_blank\">the CoinGecko team</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Market participants are always looking for trends to better understand what is taking place, why it's taking place, and its potential impacts. Historically, they use the dynamics of market cycles to act more proactively in future market environments. From Elon Musk's tweets moving the price of DOGE, to believing in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin halving</a> driving bull runs every four years, many investors use crypto narratives to predict price action. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the narrative of cryptocurrencies as a store of value has attracted many investors who view cryptocurrencies as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Similarly, the narrative of blockchain as a disruptive technology has attracted many entrepreneurs and developers working to build new applications on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Are Crypto Narratives Important?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto narratives emerge from a combination of factors, including the technological capabilities of crypto and the blockchain, social and economic events, and the beliefs and motivations of the individuals involved in the cryptocurrency industry. Mainstream media, social media, online forums, influencers, and market trends can fuel narratives. In 2024, we’re seeing a trend in narratives that explore the capabilities and application of the blockchain, such as Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). However, we're also seeing narratives like memecoins and prediction markets taking off. These narratives make the crypto market accessible to anyone, as they don't require extensive knowledge of the crypto space. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narratives are important because they play a significant role in shaping public perception and subsequently market movements. They provide a framework for people to understand the potential risks and rewards of different types of cryptocurrencies, and they can influence the trajectory of the entire cryptocurrency industry. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, crypto narratives can also be misleading or harmful based on false assumptions or hype. As such, it's important to critically evaluate narratives and base your investment decisions on sound analysis and research.</p>\n<style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n</style>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_uvcmVXLAE\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, there are multiple emerging trends and themes that are trying to define 2024. We’ll look at the top crypto narratives to watch in 2024 in this guide:</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Memecoins</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Memecoins are still one of the most profitable narratives in 2024, leading to expectations of a memecoin supercycle, with<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spx6900\" target=\"_blank\"> SPX6900</a> and<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gigachad-2\" target=\"_blank\"> Gigachad</a> topping the list of<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/best-performing-crypto-coins\" target=\"_blank\"> top gainers on CoinGecko in Q3</a>. There are also other memecoins that have achieved new heights, like how<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-goatseus-maximus-goat-memecoin-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\"> GOAT</a> became the first Pump.fun token to hit $1 billion in marketcap. At time of writing, memecoins have a total marketcap of $107.5 billion.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the name suggests, memecoins are based on memes and trends, supported by an enthusiastic community. They are usually positioned as fun tokens and usually depend on growing their community to go viral and drive growth. Memecoins can also offer traders an easy way to enter the hype around popular blockchains, as tokens are usually sold for a fraction of a cent upon launch. Unlike other narratives in this list, potential buyers do not need to have a complex understanding of the world of cryptocurrencies before buying into the hype, as most memecoins have little utility (especially upon launch). </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2024 also gave rise to memecoin generators that simplified the process of creating tokens, allowing anyone to launch their own memecoins without needing any technical expertise. The biggest player in this space is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/pump-fun-guide-how-to-create-your-own-memecoins\" target=\"_blank\">Pump.fun</a>, which is built on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-solana-sol-and-how-does-it-work?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a>. To date,<a href=\"https://dune.com/adam_tehc/pumpfun\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> over 3 million tokens</a> have been launched on Pump.fun with over $187 million in revenue. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At time of writing, Solana and Base are some of the most popular chains for memecoins. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Prediction Markets</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-prediction-markets-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Prediction markets</a> let users bet on the outcome of ongoing and future events using cryptocurrency by buying “yes” or “no” shares. Once the event has concluded, users that have picked the correct option will receive payout based on the number of shares purchased. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of these, Polymarket is the largest prediction market, with the recent Presidential Election Winner 2024 reaching over <a href=\"https://dune.com/fergmolina/polymarket-markets-data\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$732 million in volume</a>. Other popular categories for prediction markets include Sports, Business, and Popular Culture.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Liquid Restaking Tokens</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-restaking-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Restaking</a> is a growing narrative that focuses on capital efficiency, by enabling users to stake the same token and other protocols to secure multiple networks simultaneously. This enables protocols to overcome the challenges in building out their own sets of validators, while offering scalable security based on the individual protocol’s needs. In exchange, restakers enjoy an additional set of rewards based on their restaking strategy as they secure additional protocols (although this comes with an additional set of slashing risks).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/eigenlayer-restaking-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">EigenLayer</a> is the pioneer in the restaking space, with over 3.5 million ETH in TVL at time of writing. Users can restake their liquid staking tokens, such as stETH, rETH and cbETH, to secure Actively Validated Services (AVSs) on EigenLayer. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/restaking\" target=\"_blank\">liquid restaking tokens</a> on CoinGecko.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Liquid Staking Derivatives</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-liquid-staking-liquid-staked-derivatives-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid staking derivatives (LSDs)</a> are cryptocurrencies issued by liquid staking platforms, allowing stakers a means to unlock their illiquid-staked assets and generate more yield. With standard <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-staking\" target=\"_blank\">staking</a>, stakers secure proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains by depositing assets in a protocol. But this presents the issue of capital inefficiency as stakers miss the opportunity to generate extra yield when their assets are illiquid and locked up. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is where liquid staking comes in. The value of the derivative asset is pegged to the underlying asset (locked when staked on a proof-of-stake blockchain), where it continues to accumulate rewards and grow in value with time.  Meanwhile, the derivative token can be used to engage in other DeFi activities like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-crypto-loans-and-how-do-crypto-loans-work\" target=\"_blank\">lending</a> and providing <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a>. In return, most liquid staking providers take a share of 5-10% of the staking rewards as their revenue.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LSDs solve capital inefficiency, lower staking entry barriers, and improve network security and stability.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/liquid-staking-tokens\" target=\"_blank\">liquid staking tokens</a> on CoinGecko. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Blockchain Modularity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are monolithic, where the blockchain performs all tasks. However, as the basis of competition shifts from performance to cost and flexibility, the modularity era begins. Modularization breaks down the blockchain into individual components, allowing the blockchains to scale beyond their current limits.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Execution</strong>: transaction execution </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Settlement</strong>: resolution/ fraud proofs/ bridge between other execution layers  </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Consensus</strong>: agreement on the order of transactions </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/data-availability-blockchain-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Data Availability</strong></a>: providing accessible data for all network participants </p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Execution takes place on Layer 2s like Optimism and Arbitrum, which execute and send batched transactions to the parent chain. Even Layer 2s are becoming modular, as seen in the OP Stack, which modularizes all elements of a Layer 2 chain into standardized open-source modules, which developers can use to build new chains. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, EigenDA is a decentralized data availability layer built on Ethereum, and it is currently used by Mantle, a Layer 2 chain to provide data availability. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Layer 1s like Celestia are also adopting a modular architecture to their blockchain. In the case of Celestia, it focuses on consensus and data availability, optimizing storage. This lets Layer 2s built on Celestia focus on building the optimum execution environment for their applications.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Layer 1s</h2>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Layer 1s and Layer 2s on Ethereum\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/6283/content_Twitter_PoR_Roll_Out_%2814%29.png\" style=\"width: 952px; height: 544px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-1\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 1s</a> are the fundamental base architectures upon which other blockchain applications, like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contracts</a>, are built. They perform most on-chain transactions and act as public blockchains' sources of truth. Traditional L1 blockchains, like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/ethereum-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a>, tend to experience slow transaction speeds, low scalability, and high gas fee issues. This is where Layer 2 blockchains come in, as they handle the execution of transactions, leaving the L1 to focus on issuing and verifying these transactions on the blockchain. However, new L1 networks are changing the game regarding transaction speed, cost, and interoperability. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below are some examples of L1 projects to keep an eye on as the Layer 1 narrative heats up:</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Solana</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-solana-sol-and-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a> was launched in 2020, the Solana ecosystem is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/most-popular-blockchain-ecosystems\">most popular blockchain ecosystem in 2024</a>, accounting for 38.8% of crypto investor interest in chain-specific narratives. One major contributor to the Solana ecosystem’s popularity is the ongoing memecoin wave, where Solana’s speed and low gas fees, coupled with the virality of memecoin generator Pump.fun, makes it one of the top chains for memecoin speculation.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Sui</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/sui-blockchain-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Sui</a> is a \"boundless platform to build rich and dynamic on-chain assets from gaming to finance.\" It's the first permissionless L1 network designed from the bottom to help creators and developers create experiences that serve the upcoming billion users in web3. Sui was established by a team of former Meta engineers operating as Mysten Labs.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sui scales horizontally with no upper limit to meet application demand while ensuring cost-effective transaction costs. Furthermore, it significantly improves scalability by facilitating parallel agreement on simple transactions, like minting and transferring a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/non-fungible-tokens-nft\" target=\"_blank\">non-fungible token (NFT)</a>. Complex transactions, like asset management and DeFi applications, are processed by <a href=\"https://github.com/MystenLabs/narwhal\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Narwhal and Bullshark</a> DAG-based mempool and Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Layer 2s: Optimistic Rollups</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/vertical-scaling\" target=\"_blank\">vertical scaling narative</a> is focused on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols\">Layer 2s</a>, which are protocols built on top of L1s to scale and grow them further. They minimize computations of L1s by moving transactions off-chain, significantly improving their throughput. L2s total value locked (TVL) has been steadily growing, snubbing the overall DeFi market sentiments and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Optimistic rollups are L2 scaling solutions that strive to increase transaction throughput and lower fees while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchains. They leverage a trust-based model to confirm transactions off-chain and add them to the underlying blockchain after being confirmed by a small group of “witnesses.”</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9153/content_TVL_Layer_2.webp\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 385px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Source: <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl\">Beat</a></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below are some L2 optimistic rollups projects to continue watching in 2024:</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Base</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In February 2023, Coinbase launched <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/base-coinbase-layer-2\" target=\"_blank\">Base</a>, an L2 blockchain designed to serve millions of upcoming web3 users using Optimism's OP Stack and leveraging the exchange's large userbase. The network will provide a secure, cost-effective, developer-friendly solution for creators to build web3 applications. Since launch, Base has grown in popularity, with investor interest increasing in 2024 to the point it is the second most popular chain after Solana. Base is also popular among memecoin traders, with its top memecoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brett-2\" target=\"_blank\">BRETT</a>, reaching over $1 billion market cap. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Arbitrum</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/arbitrum-ecosystem-bridge-airdrop\" target=\"_blank\">Arbitrum</a> is an L2 scaling solution leveraging optimistic rollups to achieve high throughput and lower user transaction costs. Even after <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-upgrades-understanding-the-merge-and-ethereum-2\" target=\"_blank\">The Merge</a>, Ethereum's speed and gas fees are still high compared to other networks, like Arbitrum. This has led many web3 users and creators to shift networks, causing Arbitrum's TVL to hit highs of $3.2B in November 2021. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The recent <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\">ARB</a> airdrop has injected much liquidity into the Arbitrum network. Many users who received ARB tokens were incentivized to use them to trade, stake, or provide liquidity on various decentralized exchanges and protocols built on the Arbitrum network. The airdrop has also helped to increase awareness of the Arbitrum network and its potential as an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Optimism </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/optimism-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">Optimism</a> defines itself as a \"fast, stable, and scalable L2 protocol developed by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers.\" It's designed as a minimal extension to the current Ethereum blockchain to scale Ethereum applications seamlessly. Unlike the more common EVM-compatible chains, Optimism is EVM-equivalent, which means that Optimism is in full compliance with the formal specifications of the Ethereum blockchain, where Optimism moves in accordance with Ethereum. Optimism has also released the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimism-superchain-interoperability-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">OP Stack</a>, which modularizes elements of a Layer 2 chain so that developers can build new chains that interoperable with Optimism. In August 2022, Optimism saw its TVL hit a high-time high of $1.15B, according to <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Defillama</a>.  </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Layer 2s: ZK Rollups</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-proofs-and-zk-rollups\" target=\"_blank\">Zero knowledge</a> rollups (ZK rollups) are Layer 2 scaling solutions that improve Layer 1 throughput by taking computation and state storage off-chain. This way, they can process numerous transactions in batches and post summary data on-chain. Zero knowledge rollups allow you to prove knowledge of something without revealing it. This makes them an attractive solution for applications where privacy is paramount, such as digital identity verification and confidential transactions. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are examples of ZK rollups to watch out for in 2024:</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">zkSync Era</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-zksync\" target=\"_blank\">zkSync Era</a> is another L2 rollup that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without sacrificing security and decentralization aspects. It processes computations and stores most data off-chain. Using zkSync, you enjoy the Ethereum security but at a higher transaction speed and lower cost. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Polygon zkEVM </h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Polygon has launched its <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine (zkEVM)</a> Mainnet Beta on March 27, 2023, which is a big step towards scaling Ethereum and achieving mainstream web3 adoption. Like Optimism, the Polygon zkEVM is EVM-equivalent, which means that most Ethereum-native applications can function on the zkEVM and developers do not need to modify or reimplement code.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Scroll</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/scroll-airdrop\" target=\"_blank\">Scroll</a> is an L2 solution striving to offer unlimited scalability, high throughput, full decentralization, and trust-minimal privacy. It aims to achieve this by leveraging ZK rollup and high-performance off-chain decentralized systems. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Taiko</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/taiko-ethereum-equivalent-decentralized-zk\" target=\"_blank\">Taiko</a> is a zero-knowledge Layer 2 is designed to be the most Ethereum-equivalent ZK-rollup, providing dApps a scalable and efficient platform without having to make any changes to their existing protocol. Unlike many other zero-knowledge Layer 2s, Taiko is focused on achieving complete compatibility with Ethereum over the speed of ZK-proof generation, which enables the reuse of execution clients with minimal adjustments. To try out Taiko, you can participate in their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/taiko-tko-token-airdrop\" target=\"_blank\">protocol usability tests</a> on their testnet. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Layer 2s</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like other Layer 2s mentioned above, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-layer-2s-top-bitcoin-layer-2s\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Layer 2 projects</a> attempt to scale the Bitcoin blockchain by developing an execution layer that offers higher throughput and more operations than the mainnet. Layer 2s on the Bitcoin network offer execution layers that work differently from the mainnet, supporting operations like virtual machines like the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm\" target=\"_blank\">EVM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contracts</a>. However, Bitcoin L2 networks face challenges like ensuring secure bridging between Bitcoin and its L2 networks, and ensuring fast speed and low costs when settling proofs on the Bitcoin network. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Layer 2s on the Bitcoin network can include state channels like the Bitcoin Lightning Network, sidechains like Stacks and Rootstock, and even rollups like Merlin. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin: Ordinals, BRC-20 Tokens, and Runes</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-ordinals-nft\" target=\"_blank\">Ordinals</a> are among the latest trends taking Bitcoin by storm. In January 2023, software engineer Casey Rodarmor deployed the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling NFT minting on the mainnet. The move spiked mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community. Some saw the move as a threat to the Bitcoin blockchain, while others were excited and started crafting Inscriptions – Bitcoin's version of NFTs.  </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just like NFTs, Ordinal Inscriptions are digital assets inscribed on a Satoshi, the smallest denomination of a BTC. However, unlike an NFT which utilizes a decentralized file storage system, Ordinals are directly stored on-chain. The inscriptions are made possible by the <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/86027/bitcoins-biggest-upgrade-since-2017-taproot-just-went-live\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Taproot upgrade</a> introduced into the Bitcoin blockchain in November 2021.  </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The number and order of BTC Ordinals have been closely monitored, and there are some <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-ordinal-projects\" target=\"_blank\">noteworthy collections</a> and high-priced sales made so far. They include Ordinal Punks, Taproot Wizards, Bitcoin Rocks, Timechain Collectibles, Ordinal Loops, Ripcashe's Power Source, Bitcoin Shrooms, The Shadow Hats, The Dan Files, and Toruses.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To date, there are almost 55.8 million Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"NFT Ordinals Inscriptions Jan 2024\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9154/content_NFT_Ordinals_Inscriptions_Jan_2024.webp\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 608px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Source: https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis </span></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond Ordinals, there has also been an interest in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/brc-20-tokens\" target=\"_blank\">BRC-20 tokens</a>, which uses ordinal inscriptions to enable the minting and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. BRC-20 tokens are similar to the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and EVM networks. BRC-20 tokens are minted by the community, where Ordinal wallets can freely mint BRC-20 tokens once they are deployed. While still in the early stages, there are platforms that enable the decentralized minting and trading of BRC-20 tokens. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There has been a surge in interest in BRC-20 tokens in December 2023, leading to a high of over $27 average transaction fee in December 2023.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2024, with the fourth Bitcoin halving, Rodarmor is releasing a new fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin ecosystem, which will make it easier and more efficient for users to create tokens on Bitcoin. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes\" target=\"_blank\">Runes</a> will likely leverage on the popularity of meme coins, with the Rodarmor himself stating that \"Fungible tokens are 99.9% scams and memes.\" However, by creating a more efficient protocol, there is the expectation that it will bring a significant increase in transaction fee revenue, developer mind share, and users to Bitcoin. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/depin-crypto-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks\" target=\"_blank\">DePIN</a> refers to decentralized physical infrastructure networks, which use blockchains and token rewards to develop infrastructure in the physical world across different fields, such as wireless connectivity, geospatial mapping, mobility, health, energy, and more. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal of DePIN is to create resource-efficient physical infrastructure through incentivizing providers to commit their physical resources to a decentralized network. The DePIN then makes these resources available to users who are looking for cheaper service charges (relative to centralized facilities), and the network generates revenue through fees paid by the users.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/depin\" target=\"_blank\">DePIN tokens</a> on CoinGecko.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Real World Assets</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-real-world-assets-exploring-rwa-protocols\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Assets (RWAs)</a> are assets existing in the physical world or off-chain but are tokenized and transferred on-chain to act as a source of yield in DeFi. These include real estate, precious metals, commodities, and art. RWAs are a core element of the global financial system; in 2020, for example, global real estate was valued at <a href=\"https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$326.5T</a> while the gold market cap stood at <a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/gold/marketcap/#:~:text=Gold's%20Market%20Cap&amp;text=The%20Market%20Capitalization%20of%20Gold%20is%20currently%20arround%20%2412.389%20T.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$12.39 T</a>. A growing portion of RWAs are focused on the leveraging US Treasury Bills and high interest rates as a way to offer investors lower-risk yields, including companies such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ondo-finance-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Ondo Finance</a>. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">MakerDAO has also entered the RWA space by deploying idle assets into short-term bonds, using the proceeds to ramp up an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker\">MKR</a> buyback program and bolster the DAI Savings Rate, providing a clear example of how protocols could benefit from RWA investments. MakerDAO shows how value can flow to token holders, where the buyback program is driving growth of MakerDAO. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The potential impact that RWAs can have on DeFi seems huge:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">They can provide a source of sustainable and reliable yield to DeFi, as they are backed by traditional assets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">They can help DeFi to become more compatible with the traditional financial markets, ensuring more liquidity, capital efficiency, and investment opportunities. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">They can bridge the gap between DeFi and traditional finance (TradFi).</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maple\" target=\"_blank\">Maple Finance (MPL)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/goldfinch\" target=\"_blank\">Goldfinch (GFI)</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/centrifuge\" target=\"_blank\">Centrifuge (CFG)</a> are other examples of RWAs that focus on RWA lending that you can have a look at.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/real-world-assets-rwa\" target=\"_blank\">RWA tokens</a> on CoinGecko.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Telegram Trading Bots</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023, there was also a rise in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/telegram-crypto-trading-bots\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram crypto trading bots</a> that offer users convenience and efficiency when it comes to executing trades. Instead of needing a computer to connect your wallet and approve transactions, all users need to do to buy tokes is to copy and paste the token's contract address and send it as a chat to buy the token. This also speeds up the selling process, as you can pre-approve and sign transactions. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some Telegram trading bots also come with additional features like multi-wallet sniping that bypasses individual wallet restrictions on tokens, and liquidity sniping that executes a buy order once the bot detects liquidity being added to maximize gains on a new token.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learn more about the different Telegram crypto trading bots and their features in our article on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-telegram-trading-bots\" target=\"_blank\">Top 5 Telegram Trading Bots</a>. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/telegram_apps\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram apps tokens</a> on CoinGecko.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023, we saw narratives like Artificial Intelligence, Chinese tokens, and decentralized social media, alongside other narratives like Layer 1s, Layer 2s, liquid staking derivatives, real-world assets, and Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20. Moving into 2024, there are new emerging narratives like restaking, DePIN, DeSci, GambleFi, along with an interest in blockchain modularity. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember, this article is only for educational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.

The VCs listed here are not featured in any particular order. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">9. Paradigm </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paradigm was founded in 2018 by Fred Ehrsam (co-founder of Coinbase) and Matt Huang. The firm is based in San Francisco, California and specializes in investing in innovative companies and protocols in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. They take a more research-driven and hands-on approach when evaluating startups, providing guidance on technical aspects like mechanism design, smart contract security, and engineering. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of their well-known investments include the likes of: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Chainalysis</strong>: A blockchain analysis company that provides data, software, services, and research to government agencies, exchanges, and financial institutions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Matrixport</strong>: A crypto financial services platform offering digital asset custody, trading, lending, and other services. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Dapper Labs</strong>: The company behind popular blockchain-based games and collectibles platforms like CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Fireblocks</strong>: A digital asset custody and transfer solutions provider, offering secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their recent investments have a heavy focus on blockchain service, staking, and smart contract platforms. For example, they recently lead Sorella’s $7.5 million seed round on August 20, a crypto startup building tools to solve Ethereum's <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-mev-maximal-extractable-value-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">MEV</a> problem.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sorella is currently working on two tools called Brontes and Angstrom to combat MEV actors. Brontes is an OS blockchain tool that processes ETH blocks and identifies MEV through pattern matching analysis algorithms, while Angstrom is launching as a Uniswap V4 hook, preventing forms of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-crypto-arbitrage-trading-and-is-it-profitable?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">arbitrage</a> in decentralized exchanges. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To reach out to Paradigm, you can connect any of the team members on their website: <a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/team\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.paradigm.xyz/team</a></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">10. a16z</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is a venture capital firm that has been investing in crypto and web3 startups since 2013. a16z has launched four crypto funds to date, with the latest being a $4.5 billion fund announced in May 2022.

(a16z also has tremendously good Web3 research that you can check out here: <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/research/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://a16zcrypto.com/research/</a>) </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">11. 1kx</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1kx is an early-stage venture capital firm founded in 2017, primarily focused on investing in tokenized projects within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. 1kx aims to support exceptional founders in bootstrapping their token networks, positioning itself as a crypto-native fund.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The firm was co-founded by Lasse Clausen and Christopher Heymann, both of whom have backgrounds as technology founders. Their team includes various professionals, such as analysts and researchers, who contribute to the firm's investment strategies and portfolio management. 1kx is recognized for its founder-friendly approach, emphasizing hands-on support and guidance for entrepreneurs as they develop and scale their projects. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of their more well-known investments are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Kiln</strong>: A provider of enterprise-grade staking solutions, which received funding in a Series A round.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Fxhash</strong>: An NFT platform that allows users to create and trade generative art.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-pudgy-penguins-nfts?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Pudgy Penguins</a></strong>: A prominent NFT collection and Web3 IP company, which raised $9 million in a seed round led by 1kx.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More recently, 1kx has been investing in several seed round companies such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Astria</strong>: On July 1, 2024, 1kx led a Series A funding round for Astria, raising $12.5 million.

Multicoin Capital </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multicoin Capital is a venture capital firm that specializes in investments within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Founded by Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain, the firm adopts a thesis-driven approach, focusing on innovative startups that are reshaping significant markets through blockchain technology.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multicoin Capital as suggested by the name tends to make concentrated non-consensus bets in emerging projects. This contrarian strategy has led to substantial returns, with an impressive IRR of 33.8% (one of the highest) from 2020 to 2021. The firm believes in the importance of aggressive capital deployment, investing in projects that were considered “early” at that time such as Solana, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-helium-hnt?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Helium</a>, and The Graph.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their thesis is driven by the “Attention Theory of Value”, described as a shift in how markets price crypto assets. This theory states that asset prices are driven by the perceived amount of time, energy, and money devoted by a community, rather than traditional TradFi valuation models such as DCF (discounted cashflow). </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consumer interest is what makes most Web3 projects successful, and hence their investments tend to focus on projects that revolve around 2 functions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The ability to quickly create new assets</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The ability to trade those assets on any venue</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is seen in their recent investments in both early and late-stage startups, such as the popular bridge interoperability platform Wormhole, where Multicoin Capital co-led a $225 million funding round. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of earlier stage investments, this year they invested in: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>zkMe</strong>: Verifies user credentials without disclosing any personal information to anyone. It aims to provide a compliant solution for Web 3 developers amid increased regulatory scrutiny. zkMe allows users to generate anonymous proofs of their credentials, which are then automatically verified and linked to their chosen blockchain ecosystem. Service providers are able to request access to these verified claims without users having to share private data. This is done through an Identity Oracle, using Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Multi-Party Computations.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>CrunchDAO</strong>: A collective intelligence protocol that turns models into recurring revenue. They do this through a 3-step process where companies upload their obfuscated data on the platform, and Crunch hosts and makes the data available, building new models with it. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>El Dorado</strong>: The Super-App (Financial Fintech Service) that is reinventing the way you exchange, save and send money. El Dorado allows you to swap between assets, deposit them for yield, and on/offramp into fiat currencies. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Baxus</strong>: A global marketplace for the world’s most collectible spirits. In essence, it is a secure marketplace to buy and sell premium liquor via the P2P market. </p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To contact Multicoin Capital for investments inquiries, you can pitch to them directly here: <a href=\"https://multicoin.capital/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://multicoin.capital/contact/</a>. However, due to the volume of pitches they get, it is recommended you get a warm introduction. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">13. Animoca Brands<strong> </strong>\n</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Animoca Brands is a company in the digital entertainment and blockchain gaming sectors, co-founded in 2014 by Yat Siu and David Kim. Based in Hong Kong, the company initially focused on mobile game development but pivoted towards blockchain gaming and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) around 2018. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, Animoca Brands created Mocaverse, which features 8,888 unique NFTs known as Mocas aimed at creating a comprehensive ecosystem within the Web3 space. It serves as both a consumer network and a platform for identity and reputation management, integrating various elements of gaming, culture, and digital assets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This shift has positioned Animoca as a key player in a rapidly evolving Web3 landscape, where it aims to promote digital property rights and contribute to the open metaverse. This is seen with investments into startups and now notable companies such as Axie Infinity, OpenSea, Dapper Labs (NBA Top Shot), and Yield Guild Games. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interestingly, they take a hybrid model approach, not just taking tokens/equity but a share of game sales, in-game purchases, and transaction fees in their games. They recently received accolades for their rapid growth and innovation and were recognized by the Financial Times in 2023. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Animoca Brands tends to form both strategic partnerships apart from just investments, with recent interest in projects such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>hi</strong>: Animoca Brands announced a strategic partnership with hi, a Web 3 financial super app, committing to invest $30 million. This partnership aims to enhance the utility of fungible tokens and NFTs within the Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Bondex</strong>: The company secured a strategic investment in Bondex, a platform focused on Web3 recruitment, further expanding its portfolio in the blockchain space. It is also the first economically aligned talent marketplace for recruiters, talent and companies.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>CROSS THE AGES</strong>: Animoca led a $3.5 million equity round for CROSS THE AGES, which is focused on creating an innovative gaming experience. </p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To keep up with the latest news/investment information from Animoca Brands, you can check out their media coverage here: <a href=\"https://www.animocabrands.com/coverage\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.animocabrands.com/coverage</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">14. Spartan Capital </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spartan Capital, operated by the Spartan Group, is actually a fund that was founded in 2017 with its main base in Singapore and Hong Kong. Due to their unique approach that combines traditional finance practices with innovative approaches in the Web3 space, Spartan Group is recognized for its active role in venture capital, having backed numerous leading companies and networks within the crypto space. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They have a significant presence in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and capital raising, leveraging their extensive network and expertise to create value alongside innovative founders, offering advisory services for their investments.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of their older and more well-known investments include: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Merit Circle</strong>: A <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">DAO</a> dedicated to the play-to-earn gaming ecosystem, facilitating gamers' access to resources and opportunities to earn through blockchain-based games.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Maple</strong>: A decentralized finance platform designed for institutional lending, allowing users to access liquidity through a network of decentralized pools while providing attractive returns for lenders.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/pendle?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Pendle</strong></a>: A protocol that enables the tokenization of yield-generating assets, allowing users to trade future yield streams and enhance liquidity in the DeFi space.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2024, The Group tended to invest towards GameFi and Blockchain/Data Service Startups, with over 38 investments just this year.

Established to invest in early-stage companies and projects within the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, Coinbase Ventures provides funding, resources, and support to startups and entrepreneurs working on innovative blockchain and crypto-related technologies. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coinbase Ventures tends to co-invest with other prominent venture capital firms such as Pantera Capital, PolyChain Capital, and a16z. Some of its well-known investments include: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-aptos-apt?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Aptos</a></strong>: A Web3 startup focused on creating a safe and scalable Layer 1 blockchain, which uses a novel programming language called Move (originally designed by Meta engineers) Aptos has nearly 3.9M+ monthly active users and has over 1.6+ transactions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>ConsenSys</strong>: An Ethereum blockchain infrastructure and applications builder that received a $200M Series C round investment.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Yuga Labs</strong>: The company behind the popular <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-apecoin-ape-ecosystem?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)</a> which also acquired CryptoPunks and Meebits intellectual property as part of a strategic move to expand its collections.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Nansen</strong>: A blockchain analytics platform focused on Ethereum which is trusted by leading on-chain developers and analysts as a backbone for blockchain data. </p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Coinbase Ventures Investment Percentage Allocation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21502/content_7.webp\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Image Credit: DropStab</span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coinbase Ventures tends to invest early with a preference for DeFi and service/infrastructure related investments, typically at the Seed Round (Global benchmark ~Series A/B if you consider the size of the average seed round).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of their more recent investments in June and August include Morpho ($50 million round), Chaos Lab ($55 million round), and Conduit ($37 million round). </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Personally, I’m pretty keen on their investment in TurnKey in April this year, which is a crypto private key infrastructure solution which was also responsible for building Coinbase Custody, one of the world's largest and most secure custodians. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They are building a private key management platform offering the same advanced security protections major financial institutions demand but designed just for developers. Pulling this off would allow significant retail adoption by ensuring the same custodian level secure as traditional financial institutions.  </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To contact Coinbase Ventures for investment inquiries, you can reach out to any of the team members on Twitter or LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">7.

Some of these more recent project investments this year include Sentient, Allora, Inference Labs, io.net, and many more. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even though these investments tend to have an AI-driven narrative, most of them do develop underlying core technology infrastructure such as blockchain infrastructure and services. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-io-net-io-token?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">io.net</a> is an innovative decentralized computing platform that provides global access to GPU resources for machine learning and AI applications at significantly lower costs compared to traditional cloud services. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By aggregating GPUs from various sources like data centers, miners, and decentralized storage providers, they created a network of decentralized computational power that allows AI and machine learning teams to access at a fraction of the cost of traditional providers such as NVIDIA and AWS. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For investment inquiries, Delphi Ventures allows you to pitch directly via this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmR4riYNgzyfTv5ghf8iy_1qtg9Cak2fxtQ2IY485XBqWiMg/viewform\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">link.</a> Take note that you will need to provide your Telegram Handle and a PDF of your deck or Whitepaper. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Venture capital firms are crucial in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain.

As part of their token launch, some cryptocurrency projects send free tokens to their communities to drive adoption, an activity commonly known as “<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-airdrop-and-how-does-it-differ-from-an-ico\">airdrops</a>.” But what are airdrops, and how do you qualify for these free tokens? Read on!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1\">What Are Crypto Airdrops?</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrency projects are big on incentivization as a way to drive interest towards their brand and the product itself, and airdrops are designed to introduce users to the project and reward them in the process as a dual marketing and reward system. As you'll see in the list below, one of the most common ways to improve your eligibility for new airdrops is to use the testnet or interact with the protocol. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Early airdrop programs were basically structured to introduce a new or existing project to the cryptocurrency community by rewarding new users who perform simple social tasks. On completion, the participants receive a certain number of token rewards. Currently, airdrop programs are adopting a point system, where the points users earn are converted to a share of the airdropped tokens. Users can usually earn these <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/defi-trends-crypto#3-the-points-and-airdrop-meta\" target=\"_blank\">points</a> by taking part in the project’s testnet, providing liquidity, and engaging in social tasks. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/biggest-crypto-airdrops\" target=\"_blank\">Over the past five years</a>, airdrops have changed as the goal has shifted towards rewarding early adopters and significant contributors. After <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap\" target=\"_blank\">Uniswap</a>’s high profile airdrop in 2020, where $6.43 billion worth of UNI was distributed (valued at its ATH token price of $42.88), every year has recorded significant airdrops:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">On 25th December 2021, OpenDAO airdropped a major portion of its <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opendao\" target=\"_blank\">SOS</a> token to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft\" target=\"_blank\">NFT</a> traders on OpenSea. </p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Some of the most popular airdrops of 2022 were <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/bored-ape-yacht-club\" target=\"_blank\">BAYC</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin\" target=\"_blank\">Apecoin</a> airdrop to its NFT art holders, Ethereum <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2</a> network <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-optimism-op\" target=\"_blank\">Optimism</a>’s airdrop of its <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism\" target=\"_blank\">OP token</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aptos\" target=\"_blank\">Aptos</a>’s airdrop to its early adopters.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In 2023, we've already seen the Arbitrum airdrop, with over 42 million <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\">ARB</a> claimed in the first hour. Other high profile airdrops in 2023 include Celestia's TIA and Blur.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/2024-q2-crypto-report#read-the-report-coingecko-s-2024-q2-crypto-industry-report\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko Q2 2024 report</a>, there were 21 notable airdrops including Ethena, zkSync, LayerZero, EigenLayer, and friend.tech, which added $7.7 billion to the overall crypto market cap in Q2 of 2024.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the year 2024 already upon us, let’s take a look at some likely airdrops that might be happening soon, and how you can qualify for these upcoming crypto airdrops.</p>\n\n<p>Do note that unless specified otherwise, these potential airdrops are highly speculative and a feature in this list is no guarantee that an actual airdrop will happen in the future.</p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0cKJqaoMd4?si=j08YNDZug9OeN5re\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Linea: EVM-Equivalent ZK Layer 2 Rollup by Consensys</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-linea?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Linea</a> is an Ethereum-equivalent Layer 2 zero knowledge network developed by Consensys, the developers behind the MetaMask wallet. As an Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM, its execution environment is compatible with existing applications deployed on Ethereum. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It improves transaction speed and reduces cost by using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimistic-vs-zero-knowledge-rollups?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">rollup</a> technology to submit transactions to the mainnet in batches. Like other zero knowledge rollup networks, Linea uses the ZK validity proofs to assess the accuracy of data before submitting bundled up transactions to the mainnet. By recording transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, Linea inherits the level of security on the mainnet while maintaining a high-throughput execution environment. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At time of writing, Linea’s TVL is at $547 million.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Linea is running a points program known as Linea Voyages, where users will receive Linea XP Points (LXP) based on their contributions. This is split into Linea Voyage LXP (LXP), which is earned through exploring dApps in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/linea-ecosystem?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Linea ecosystem</a>, and The Surge (LXP-L), which is earned through providing liquidity in the Linea ecosystem. Linea’s Surge program will last for six months, or until its TVL hits $3 billion.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can improve your airdrop eligibility for Linea by bridging assets to Linea and taking part of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-earn-the-linea-airdrop-for-h2-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Linea Voyages to earn LXP</a>. You can also provide <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> by holding assets on Linea, which will let you accrue LXP-L. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Berachain: EVM-Identical Layer 1 Utilizing Proof-of-Liquidity</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Berachain is an EVM-Identical Layer 1 blockchain built on the Beaconkit framework – a Cosmos SDK-based framework that enables developers to build execution layers tailored for the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>. This means its execution layer is identical to the EVM, allowing developers to directly deploy their Ethereum-based apps onto Berachain, while allowing Berachain to adopt the latest version of the EVM whenever it is forked or updated, without required any modifications.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Berachain runs on the Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism that builds on Proof-of-Stake by introducing a soulbound <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">governance token</a> that determines the rewards for stakers. This separates token responsibilities by separating gas tokens from tokens used to govern chain rewards for security. In PoL users who wish to contribute to the consensus layer are required to provide liquidity by committing the native BERA coin or any other token accepted on the rewards vault and receiving BGT (BeraChain Governance token) which is then delegated to a validator.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bera Chain has raised over $140 million through multiple funding events to develop the network.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BERA token is confirmed and BeraChain is running a public testnet program. While a community airdrop is yet to be announced at the time of writing, participants in the testnet program and other promotional programs expect the project to reward early contributors via a token airdrop, as seen in previous airdrops from other protocols that have run similar programs.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Participating in the testnet program and other social media promotional programs are some of the best ways to improve your chances of benefiting from a potential BERA airdrop. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/potential-berachain-airdrop-testnet-interactions\" target=\"_blank\">Follow this guide to learn more</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Jupiter: Solana’s Largest DEX Aggregator</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-jupiter-crypto-solana?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Jupiter</a> is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator on the Solana network. As a DEX aggregator, it helps traders find the best rates for token swaps by efficiently routing orders across various decentralized exchanges on Solana, such as Raydium, Meteora, and others. To date, over <a href=\"https://dune.com/ilemi/jupiter-aggregator-solana\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$345,000,000,000</a> in trading volume has been routed through Jupiter. This means that roughly 50% of all trades on Solana are routed through Jupiter.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its launch Jupiter has experienced rapid growth, introducing their very own perpetuals exchange, memecoin terminal and even acquiring other crypto infrastructure firms, SolanaFM and Coinhall. Jupiter is a fast grower in 2024, quickly positioning themselves as a major DeFi conglomerate in Solana, making their airdrop one to look forward to.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why An Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On January 31, 2024, Jupiter launched its first airdrop campaign, “Jupuary\". The team also announced plans for 3 additional Jupuarys (airdrop campaigns), to be held annually on 31 January for the next three years. As the next Jupuary approaches on January 31, 2025, there have been no further official announcements from the Jupiter team. However, there has been growing discussions on the community forum regarding how the next Jupuary should be allocated. It is expected that the team will make official comments to this in coming months.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can improve your eligibility by using the large suite of products Jupiter launched this year. Some of your options include, staking JUP tokens and voting on community proposals, liquidity providing to the perpetuals exchange, using the native dollar cost average (DCA) function and more! For a more in depth guide on farming Jupiter read our Solana airdrops guide <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-solana-airdrops\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Karak: Restaking Platform as an Alternative to EigenLayer</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/eigenlayer-restaking-ethereum?locale=en\">EigenLayer</a>, Karak is a multi-chain <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-restaking-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">restaking</a> layer designed to provide crypto-economic security across various blockchains. It supports assets including Ethereum, Solana, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2</a> tokens. It also operates as a marketplace where developers can incentivize users to restake their staked assets, providing on-demand crypto-economic security for developers of new protocols, removing the need for these developers to build a new trust network from scratch. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the Karak platform, users who staked their assets can allocate them to a Distributed Secure Service (DSS) which enables these staked assets to be reused for security purposes by other protocols. By allocating their assets to the DSS, stakers agree to additional slashing conditions in return for improved staking income. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Karak reportedly raised $48 million at a valuation of $1 billion in their Series A funding round led by Lightspeed Ventures and supported by Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital, and more.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.coingecko.com/learn/potential-karak-airdrop-earn-karak-xp\" target=\"_blank\">Karak</a> is currently running a point program where users earn XP points by interacting with the platform through restaking and also by referring other users. Points earned from this program could translate into token rewards in a prospective airdrop, as seen in the current points meta taking place. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can improve your chances of benefiting from a potential Karak airdrop by participating in the ongoing XP program.  However, you will need to get an early access invite code to participate. You can take part by acquiring and restaking supported assets and inviting others to the program. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Pump.fun: The World’s Most Successful Memecoin Generator</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/pump-fun-guide-how-to-create-your-own-memecoins?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Pump.fun</a> is currently the leader in crypto launchpads for memecoins, operating on the Solana network. Pump.fun is a platform that simplifies the token creation process, abstracting away all technical complexities allowing everyday users to create their own memecoins for as low as $2.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its inception in early 2024, Pump.fun has <a href=\"https://dune.com/adam_tehc/pumpfun\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">generated</a> over $170 million in revenue with almost 3 million tokens launched via the platform. This means that an airdrop from the platform could potentially be highly lucrative given the platform’s current success. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why An Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Pump.fun team teased launching their own token during a <a href=\"https://x.com/pumpdotfun/status/1847408704036974975\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Spaces</a> on 19 October 2024. One of the team members said “We're going to make sure we're going to reward our earliest users\", making it likely the project will launch their token via an airdrop.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While there are currently no points programme available, it is presumed that active use of the platform will improve one’s airdrop eligibility. To improve your eligibility, you could consider creating your own memecoins and trading memecoins through the platform.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Fuel: Modular Layer 2 Designed for Scalability Utilizing Parallelization </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-fuel-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Fuel Network</a> is a modular scaling solution for the Ethereum network, separating the execution layer from the data availability and consensus layer. By separating responsibilities based on their layers, modular blockchains are built for scaling, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To improve transaction processing speed and scalability, Fuel employs <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-parallelization-parallel-execution-blockchain?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">parallelization</a> in its execution layer. Fuel has also created a virtual machine that reduces energy wasted on processing, while offering increased design flexibility. The network is built using the Sway programming language – a flexible language that draws on the best of Rust and Solidity to reduce time to production.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At time of writing, Fuel network has raised $81.5 million over two funding rounds, with backers including Origin Capital, CoinFund, Stratos Technologies, and more. Fuel has also launched its public testnet on Sepolia.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fuel has also launched the Fuel Points program, where early contributors can earn points by depositing assets into the Fuel pre-deposit contract. Assets locked on the contract earn points as long as they remain deposited in the contract, although withdrawal of deposited funds before the Fuel Mainnet launch will result in the loss of associated Fuel points. While it is not guaranteed that accumulating Fuel Points will equate to a token airdrop, it is likely based on other projects that launched similar programs.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taking part in the Fuel Points program is likely to be the primary way to qualify for the prospective airdrop. In the future, when the mainnet is launched, early depositors can also earn points for activities on the mainnet. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Initia: A Network for Interwoven Rollups </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/potential-initia-airdrop\" target=\"_blank\">Initia</a> is a Cosmos-based network focused on interoperability, creating interconnected blockchains through its infrastructure that combines Layer 1 and Layer 2 technology. On Initia, different Layer 2 networks and appchains (Minitias) can operate without requiring native consensus mechanisms. Through Initia’s Enshrined Liquidity mechanism, multiple tokens can be staked directly with validators to gain voting power through a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism. This will allow for efficient allocation of assets, while allowing other tokens within whitelisted liquidity pools to be utilized for gas payments.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Initia also simplifies the process of creating a new appchain, by combining its tech stack with offering features such as native stablecoins and multi-chain bridging, while using the Initia Layer 1 for security and data settlement.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rollups on the Initia network are known as Minitia and the interoperability infrastructure is termed Omnitia. Thanks to Omnitia, validators can validate a basket of Minitia, securing multiple networks and earning rewards from each network. According to Initia, Minitias are high-throughput L2 networks with a block time of 500ms and transaction speed of over 10,000 TPs.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Initia Network reportedly raised $7.5 million in its seed round fundraiser program backed by Binance Labs and Co-led by Delphi Ventures and Hack VC with participation from Nascent, Figment Capital, Big Brain, A.Capital, and various angel investors</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Initia has confirmed a token launch, although there is no official announcement regarding a token airdrop. However, the launch of an XP program suggests that there is the possibility of a future airdrop.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To improve your airdrop eligibility, you can complete tasks including getting testnet tokens, buying an Initia username, swapping tokens, staking INIT with validators and more. Completing these tasks will let you create a Jennie, which is an NFT. After completing the Jennie, you will have to continue earning XP by interacting with the Minitia and completing weekly bonus tasks in order to feed your Jennie.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Eclipse: Layer 2 on Ethereum Leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eclipse is an EVM-compatible zero knowledge Layer 2 that is built using the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-the-solana-virtual-machine-svm?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)</a>. The project aims to fuse the speed and performance of the SVM – leveraging features like parallelization – while settling transactions on the Ethereum network. This creates an extremely fast rollup while maintaining Ethereum-level security and decentralization, while utilizing Celestia for data availability. As a </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, by utilizing the SVM, developers can now deploy Solana apps on Eclipse with minimal changes. The project also recently unveiled Neon Stack, a technology suite that will make the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and SVM interoperable. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eclipse is currently running a testnet program, and while it is not certain that participation in the testnet will result in an airdrop, there is a good chance of early adopters receiving an airdrop, as many past projects have rewarded testnet users for their contributions to the final product.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To improve your eligibility for the potential airdrop, you can start by getting involved in the project. On Eclipse, you can do so by installing the Eclipse wallet and interacting with dApps on the testnet. As Eclipse is still in the testnet stage, you will need to acquire <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/sepolia-eth?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sepolia ETH</a> to engage in testnet activities.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Zora: Creator-Focused Protocol With a Layer 2 to Bring Media Onchain</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-zora-and-zora-network-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Zora</a> is a creator-centric decentralized NFT platform that enables creators to capture a share of the resale value of their work. On Zora, creators and collectors come together to determine the value of an NFT through auctions, fostering a decentralized market dynamic. According to the project, over 4 million NFTs have minted, with $300 million generated in secondary sales, since its launch in 2021 on Ethereum. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, there is also the Zora Network which was created to bring scalability, speed, and cost efficiency to the Zora marketplace, simplifying NFT creation and minting operations via its SDK. The Zora Network, an EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain solution built using the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimism-superchain-interoperability-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">OP Stack</a> and designed to support media on the blockchain, was launched in June 2023. While the Zora Network is designed to complement the Zora marketplace by facilitating the minting, pricing, and trading of NFTs, it also functions as a standalone Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is the possibility for a ZORA token, as it has raised $60 million in funding from investors including Paradigm and Coinbase Ventures. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To improve your eligibility for a potential Zora airdrop, you can interact with Zora and Zora Network by buying, listing, minting, and selling NFTs. Also, given Zora’s creator focus, creating an NFT and getting as many mints as possible may also determine the size of a potential airdrop. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Farcaster: Decentralized Web3 Social Protocol on Optimism</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-farcaster-warpcast-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">Farcaster</a> described itself as a ‘sufficiently decentralized’ social media protocol built on the Optimism network. It is developed to serve as a base layer for a range of social media applications. The most popular application on Farcaster is Warpcast, which takes inspiration from Twitter (X), where users can share short posts (or casts) and follow personalities and join interest-based channels.  Warpcast features Farcaster protocol innovations like Frames – a feature that allows users to access another app from within their social feed, improving the user experience.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Farcaster has raised about $180 million across two funding rounds, with investors including Paradigm, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures, and more. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why an Airdrop Is Likely</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Farcaster is expected to follow in the steps of a fellow decentralized social media project – <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/friend-tech-social-app-base?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">friend.tech</a>. Both projects are funded by Paradigm, which has a record of investing in projects that issue tokens. Moreover, with significant potential as seen in its $1 billion valuation and substantial funding, it is possible that the project will eventually offer an airdrop to reward its users. </p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Improving Your Airdrop Eligibility</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As in the case of friend.tech, user interactions and activity on Warpcast is likely to be a determining factor for the airdrop. Earning a Powerbadge (a small purple badge next to your name) could also improve your chances of scoring a potential Farcaster airdrop, as it will prove that you are a power user of Warpcast. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve gone through some likely drops for 2024, however, this list is non-exhaustive and there are no guarantees that the drops listed here will eventually happen. That said, there are recurring trends in what you can do to improve your eligibility, such as staying active in the space and interacting with the project. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, this content is provided for educational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.

It will be built on Optimism's OP Stack, and will be part of the Optimism Superchain network. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kraken, one of the biggest centralized exchanges, is planning to roll out its own Layer 2 blockchain: Ink.</li>\n\t<li>Ink will be built on Optimism's OP Stack, and will be a part of the Optimism Superchain network, with the rollout planned for early 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div><img alt=\"What is Ink Kraken Crypto\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21590/content_What_is_Ink_Kraken_Crypto.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">The crypto landscape is about to get more interesting in early 2025. Kraken, one of the biggest names in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-centralized-crypto-exchanges-cex?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">centralized exchanges</a>, is gearing up to drop their own <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/layer-2-l2?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2 (L2)</a> blockchain called Ink. If you're wondering why this matters – it's actually a pretty big deal for making DeFi more accessible to everyday users.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's what makes Ink stand out: it's not just another L2. Built on Optimism's Superchain technology, Ink is designed to be a bridge between the familiar world of centralized exchanges and the sometimes intimidating realm of DeFi. Personally, I'm most excited about how it's tackling one of crypto's biggest hurdles – making the whole \"going onchain\" process less daunting for newcomers by leveraging on the existing Kraken brand. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Want specific details? The rollout is planned for early 2025, and from what we can see from the media coverage, Kraken's not just dipping their toes in – they're diving deep into making DeFi accessible for their massive user base. Here’s everything you need to know and do to maximize the full benefits of this announcement. </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Introducing Ink: Another L2 Again? </h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ink isn't just another Layer 2 joining the blockchain party. When a crypto OG like Kraken (yes, they've <strong>been around since 2011</strong>, even before Binance) decides to launch their own blockchain, you know something interesting is brewing. After all, look at Coinbase’s success with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/base-coinbase-layer-2?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Base</a>, they’ve made it easy for consumers to move tokens over from Coinbase without the need for seed phrases and the complexity of other wallets.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This isn't just another exchange trying to catch the L2 wave – Ink represents a major Western exchange-backed blockchain specifically designed for DeFi. While we've seen Asian exchanges like Binance and OKX dive into their own chains, Kraken's bringing something different to the table. For those who might not know, Kraken's been a cornerstone of crypto adoption since the early days, surviving multiple bear markets and maintaining one of the cleanest security records in the industry.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">LIVE NOW -- Announcing Ink | Kraken's L2<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben_chain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ben_chain</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Optimism?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Optimism</a> and Andrew Koller from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krakenfx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@krakenfx</a> join us today to talk about Kraken’s latest release -- Ink, a blockchain built on the OP Stack, joining the Superchain to scale Ethereum.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/inkonchain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@inkonchain</a> offers 1-second block times… <a href=\"https://t.co/mag7NSZKQ8\">pic.twitter.com/mag7NSZKQ8</a></p>\n— Bankless (@BanklessHQ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ/status/1849451010416152919?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2024</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What really makes Ink stand out is its unique position in the market. Kraken's already helped millions of people get into crypto through their centralized exchange (they've got a massive user base that's been vetted through some of the strictest compliance standards in the industry). As mentioned by <strong>Andrew Koller in an exclusive Bankless interview</strong>, they're building a bridge to DeFi that leverages all that trust and experience. That's not just another L2 play – that's about bringing serious institutional credibility to the DeFi space.</p>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Diagram on Superchain Projects\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21584/content_1729249871131-214526.webp\" style=\"float: left; width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2147909\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Catcher </a></span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The technical foundation is solid too. By leveraging <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-optimism-op?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Optimism</a>'s open-source <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimism-superchain-interoperability-ethereum?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">OP Stack</a> (which is MIT-licensed), Ink isn't just joining the Ethereum ecosystem – it's becoming part of something bigger called the Superchain. Think of it as joining a network of blockchains that all share the same security standards, governance, and values. For the tech folks out there, this means you're getting Ethereum's battle-tested security while being part of a system that's actually helping scale Ethereum itself. In the long run, the Superchain promises interoperability across its ecosystem and beyond, where liquidity will eventually be shared everywhere across the different chains in the Superchain.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The numbers back this up too. According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-24/crypto-exchange-kraken-plans-to-launch-its-own-blockchain-early-next-year\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>, this model's already proven profitable – just look at Coinbase <strong>pulling in $53 million in sequencer revenue in Q2 alone</strong>. Sequencers are responsible for organizing transactions in a roll-up before sending it to Ethereum for processing, and Kraken's positioning as Ink's sequencer isn't just about control – it's about creating a sustainable economic model that can support long-term ecosystem growth.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's where it gets interesting: Ink isn't launching into the void. They're coming in hot with <strong>over a dozen <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/decentralized-application-dapp?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">dApps</a> ready to go</strong>, focusing on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-real-world-assets-exploring-rwa-protocols?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">real-world assets</a> and advanced lending platforms. For the DeFi enthusiasts out there, this means you're not just getting another platform – you're getting an entire ecosystem that's been thoughtfully designed from day one.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What Should You Do As A Retail User?</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Mint the Official NFT from Zora, you can do so by visiting this <a href=\"https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5d1e1a5cdd95f68ff18d78242c252f6ceaa4538b/2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. This will also grant you the OG Role in the official <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/inkonchain\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Discord channel.</a> This may be a useful role if there are potential airdrops in the future should a token be released.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If you are a developer, you can claim the Ink Apprentice Dev Role by verifying you have deployed a contract on either ETH/OP/BASE/ARB/MATIC/BNB or have a Github account older than one year. You can do so by verifying on the <a href=\"https://guild.xyz/inkonchain\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">guild website</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Subscribe to their website newsletter for official updates <a href=\"https://inkonchain.com/en-US\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The Testnet will be released during DevCon in Bangkok, and the Mainnet will be out in Q1 2025. Remember to verify all links before signing any contract with the official web pages.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This isn't just about adding another chain to the crypto universe. It's about an established, trusted player with over a decade of crypto experience saying, \"We know what users need, and we're building it from the ground up.\" When you combine Kraken's regulatory compliance track record, their deep understanding of what institutional and retail users actually want, and their commitment to DeFi innovation, Ink starts looking less like another L2 and more like a serious contender for bridging the gap between CeFi and DeFi.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Always do your own research on any crypto project, and make sure that you verify any sites and protocols that you are connecting your wallet to.

The Bitcoin Ordinals project is one of the largest tokens on the Bitcoin network created via the BRC-20 inscription technology.

Assets like Bitcoin and Solana saw their value swing, while others, like Ethereum, saw slow price movement after August’s dip. In spite of this, the above cryptocurrencies have enjoyed significant price gains – especially memecoins. Some other narratives with a presence in this list includes DePIN/AI projects, as well as Layer 0s and Layer 1s. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That said, there may be other cryptocurrencies with impressive price gains in this quarter, such as MOODENG, which did not make the list as we only considered cryptocurrencies that were created before July 1 2024. This list is also restricted to cryptocurrencies within the top 300 by market capitalization. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is only for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.

However, there are a few challenges that have emerged, mainly that its programming languages have a steep learning curve as well as that most Telegram bot applications lack advanced on-chain modules.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DuckChain is the first TON Layer 2 that connects TON with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/ethereum-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/bitcoin-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin’s</a> ecosystems. The project aims to bring billions of Telegram users from off-chain to on-chain and encourage mass adoption. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By leveraging the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) ecosystem to connect TON to Ethereum, DuckChain can access a large pool of resources, established DeFi protocols, and a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, TON can integrate with proven technologies and attract developers who are well versed with the EVM environment. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On top of that, integrating TON with the Bitcoin ecosystem provides a way for DuckChain to reach one of the largest markets in the crypto space. This integration will include the BTC mainnet, BTC Layer 2 solutions, and even the Babylon ecosystem to broaden the reach into significant liquidity and user bases.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DuckChain has designed its infrastructure to provide a unified gas experience for users less familiar with cryptocurrencies through Telegram star payment. For years, businesses have been selling products on Telegram via bots and mini apps with users paying through conventional methods such as credit cards. On June 6, 2024, Telegram introduced Stars, a method to pay for digital goods and services via in-app purchases. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to lower user barriers, DuckChain is tokenizing Telegram Stars and introducing <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/account-abstraction-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">account abstraction</a> to allow users to convert Stars into on-chain tokens to pay for gas and transaction fees. This simplified process helps to remove complex cross-chain operations. Meanwhile, users more familiar with cryptocurrencies can pay for gas fees using multiple tokens including TON.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In anticipation of DuckChain’s official launch, the project is now running the DuckChain Star Season Testnet event to onboard users into the DuckChain ecosystem. Users can experience the network and get a better understanding of DuckChain without the need for cryptocurrencies or wallets. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead, users will need to deposit Telegram Stars to participate in activities such as minting NFTs. The Stars deposited during the testnet will be stored and synchronized on the mainnet in the future. Additionally, any Stars spent in the testnet phase will not affect the user’s balance. DuckChain will be giving away 12 million Stars to testnet participants in an airdrop and has stated that deposited Stars are crucial for future airdrop eligibility. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The DuckChain team has announced that the DuckChain Airdrop Snapshot will be taken on November 18, 2024. </strong></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Join the Testnet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Go to <a href=\"https://duckchain.io/events\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://duckchain.io/events</a> and <strong>Get Your Duck NFT Now!</strong> to open the Telegram bot.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Duckchain Testnet events\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21542/content_1._Testnet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 651px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After you select to Start, you can <strong>Join for DUCK!</strong> and it will open the mini application. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Open Duckchain Telegram mini-app\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21543/content_1.1_Start.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 896px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enter your name and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Enter Duck Planet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21544/content_1.2_Create_name.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 896px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then <strong>Join Star Season</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Join Duckchain Star Season\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21545/content_1.3_Join_Star_Season.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 896px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Connect Wallet</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Click <strong>Connect</strong> to create your own wallet on DuckChain.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Connect to create wallet on DuckChain\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21546/content_2._Connect.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 901px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Deposit Stars</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scroll down and you will be able to see the three tasks on DuckChain Testnet.

With Bitcoin's independent and decentralized nature, as well as  stablecoin offerings that are tied to more reliable fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, these virtual assets have created a beacon of hope in protecting one from the worst forms of inflation. But will crypto be able to provide a truly sustainable solution for economies teetering on the edge of collapse? </p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Causes and Consequences</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hyperinflation is an extreme form of inflation in which prices balloon wildly, with the value of a nation's currency shrinking fast. This creates a spiral of chaos and the breakdown of society. While numerous factors can contribute to hyperinflation, it is often a result of significant political unrest, unsound economic policies, and excessive unbridled money printing, resulting in a complete loss of faith in the government and institutions administering the country and economy. With few exceptions, those governments that fail to keep confidence in their currencies use this measure, thereby hastening their economies' destruction.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2024, hyperinflation continued to wreak havoc on Venezuela. A far cry from the zenith reached in 2018, but nonetheless, it was a clear indication of unimaginable economic hardship. Venezuela's crisis is brought about by the country's persistent reliance on oil exports and an ill-driven economic policy. The country's inflation rate has fallen from 190% to 60% this year, but many analysts expect inflation to return to 150% as early as <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/371895/inflation-rate-in-venezuela/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a>. Governmental efforts have not managed to stabilize its economy and currency, and greater peso depreciation increases poverty levels. Zimbabwe, suffering from hyperinflation during the 2000s, is again entangled in unremitting inflation, with rates close to 600% in 2024​. Record-breaking inflation has revived apprehensions about another currency collapse as the central bank grapples with monetary overexpansion.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\"><img alt=\"Inflation rate, average consumer prices (2024)\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21538/content_Inflation_rate__average_consumer_prices_%282024%29.webp\" style=\"width: 1050px; height: 602px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size:11px;\">Inflation rate, average consumer prices (2024). Source: IMF</span></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hyperinflation often follows a three-stage progression:</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">First Wave: Inflationary Build-Up</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This first stage, characterized by increasing government debt and unrestrained spending, has 10-50% annual inflation rates. While it is still possible to reverse course and restore the economy in this stage if appropriate action is taken, historically, this was the stage of early 2000s Argentina, when that country defaulted on its debt and ended the peg between its currency, the Argentine peso, and the US dollar.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Second Wave: Accelerating Inflation</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the economy tanks and government debts build up, a deadly spiral begins when the government prints money excessively to attempt to remedy the problem. This could result in inflation rates above 50% per year, the second phase of accelerating inflation. This phase was observed in Venezuela between 2014 and 2017 when inflation dramatically grew from 56% to over 2,600%​. Similarly, Zimbabwe's inflation rate increased in 2006-2007 from 100% to more than 11,000%​. Citizens turn away from the local currency to foreign currencies or hard assets to store value.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Third Wave: Full-Blown Hyperinflation</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When inflation exceeds 50% per month, the economy reaches the last stage of hyperinflation. In 2018, Venezuela reached this threshold as, through that year, prices had been doubling every 26 days. In 2024, Zimbabwe is feared to be on the verge of repeating this pattern since inflation surged at 600%, with effective monetary controls by the government still a challenge. Such a failure of policy measures quickens the collapse in which citizens increasingly employ foreign currencies, hard assets, or more recently cryptocurrencies to protect their savings and earnings.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Consequences of Hyperinflation</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The social and economic consequences of hyperinflation are tremendous. In Venezuela, prices for basic goods have soared so high that many people can no longer afford food, let alone anything else. By October 2024, the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, remains below <a href=\"https://efe.com/en/economy/2024-01-09/venezuelan-workers-protest-starvation-wages-and-demand-decent-income/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">US$10 per month</a>, meaning the great majority of this population desperately tries to survive on a meager pay. In Argentina, inflation has decimated savings, leaving close to <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/argentinas-poverty-rate-soars-past-50-under-javier-milei/a-70341471\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">40% of the population​ in poverty</a>. The fast devaluation of the Argentine peso has significantly eroded purchasing power, while government attempts at currency stabilization have been, by and large, ineffective. In Zimbabwe, <a href=\"http://www.thezimbabwemail.com/business/bread-price-go-up-bakers-cite-increased-tax/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">basic groceries like bread have risen to 15,000​ ZWL</a>, while growing inflationary pressure has caused social unrest that culminates in protests against the unsustainable cost of living.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traditional measures have failed: interest rate increases, price and capital controls, and currency redenominations. In Zimbabwe, for example, there have been at least four currency redenominations since 2008, removing zeros from its currency each time but failing to fix fiscal instability​.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In turn, Argentina also performs all types and forms of currency resets, yet confidence in the Argentine peso still remains very low.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond economics, hyperinflation destroys social structures and makes inequality worse. Those who can hold foreign currencies or hard assets are better insulated from this mess, while the rest genuinely suffer due to the collapsed value of a national currency. During more profound hyperinflation, many people seek alternative means of saving their capital, including cryptocurrencies that offer protection against inflation, and allow conducting transactions outside the traditional financial system.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Promise of Crypto</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From speculative investment to an essential tool of survival, cryptocurrencies play an increasingly significant role in countries like Argentina and Venezuela following their economies' hyperinflation. Bitcoin and stablecoins are becoming the new staples that offer a safer haven where conventional systems have fallen short.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2024, with an incredible 276% inflation, Bitcoin started gaining popularity as a hedge against the sharply devaluating Argentinian peso. Unlike centralized fiat, the supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins with a stable emissions schedule, thus protected from sudden increases in supply. These features make it immensely appealing in a country where storing wealth in the local currency is at risk of complete erosion. Presently, Argentina enjoys one of the most active Bitcoin markets in the world. For example, between 2023 and 2024, the country saw over $91.1 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.net/news/finance/29909020/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pushing Brazil down the list.​</a></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, while Bitcoin has its appeal, the inherent volatility of the investment means that, for many, it really is better thought of as a long-term store of value rather than as some kind of day-to-day transactional asset. Some Argentinians use it to flee inflation, while others use the more stable alternative in stablecoins for everyday transactions.</p>\n\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Technical Analysis on Bitcoin</h4>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BTCUSD, Weekly</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"BTC Technical Analysis\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21539/content_BTC_Technical_Analysis.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the Weekly timeframe, BTCUSD formed a bullish flag pattern. The price has reached the upper boundary of the flag, but there may be a small bounce before the Bull Run starts. </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If the price breaks the upper trend line, it will start to rise to 74000 and then to 90000, corresponding to 161.8 Fibonacci;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A rebound from the trendline could drop Bitcoin to 60000 and then already start rising.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoins</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoins such as Tether USDT and USDC have become critical in countries like Argentina and Venezuela for holding the lines of financial security. These coins are pegged to the US dollar, making them a safe haven for hyperinflation-torn economies. In Argentina,<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/argentina-leads-latin-america-crypto-inflows\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 61.8% of all crypto-asset transactions are stablecoins</a> – significantly above the global average. The trend also reflects a preference for a reliable store of value and efficient medium of exchange in light of severe currency devaluation.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, stablecoin trading volume surged when the Argentine peso slumped to less than $0.004 in July 2023. By the end of 2023, stablecoin transactions had already jumped to over $10 million per month as citizens sought ways to protect their wealth from the government’s economic reforms, including a 50% peso devaluation.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Venezuela, the economic collapse has lasted more than a decade; crypto, especially stablecoins, became a vital alternative to the quite unstable bolívar. Despite government crackdowns and a failed national cryptocurrency experiment in Petro, high crypto adoption has been recorded amongst the populace. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-remittances-venezuela-surge-economic-situation-worsens\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crypto accounted for 9% of the $5.4 billion sent to Venezuela this year as remittances</a>, underlining crypto's sustaining role in keeping financial lifelines open.​</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeFi and Remittances</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrencies are also taking over both the landscape of basic financial services and cross-border remittances. In countries like Venezuela and Argentina, where the traditional financial systems have gone haywire, many depend on DeFi platforms to access basic services such as loans and savings. Cryptocurrencies also get around the expensive and painfully slow traditional remittance systems. In the case of Bitcoin or stablecoins, Venezuelans abroad can send money home much quicker and at a fraction of the cost, giving families a better chance of surviving a decidedly impossible economic environment.​</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Practical Applications</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrencies have become indispensable tools in several countries' fight against hyperinflation, offering an alternative to fiat currencies.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Brazil</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brazil's interest in cryptocurrencies is strongly linked to economic volatility and the devaluation of Brazilian real estate relative to the US dollar. By 2024, stablecoins like USDT and USDC accounted for 70% of the flow from local exchanges, reflecting the growing need for dollar-pegged assets to combat inflation​. Unlike Venezuela or Argentina, which primarily use cryptocurrencies for personal transactions, Brazil's adoption is highly driven by business-to-business cross-border payments, using stablecoins as an important tool to help companies facing an unstable domestic currency.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Its rapid digital transformation has made it a big attraction for major players like Circle, in <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-launches-in-brazil-to-catalyze-digital-dollar-access\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration</a> with local Brazilian firms, to allow Brazilians to make and receive low-cost, instant payments. As more companies began to conduct international trade using stablecoins, demand for traditional banking services are at risk of being superseded by these more efficient, decentralized alternatives​. In addition to B2B uses, Brazilian consumers have also embraced stablecoins as protection against inflation. In total, the volume of the amount transacted in stablecoins increased 207% from 2023 to 2024, and that trend is likely to continue with Brazil's inflation still elevated​.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Countries by crypto value received\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21540/content_Countries_by_crypto_value_received.webp\" style=\"width: 750px; height: 491px;\"></div>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Argentina</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amongst these countries, Argentina, which suffered from hyperinflation, represents perhaps the most striking example of crypto adoption as a tool against hyperinflation​. With a currency constantly losing value, Argentine citizens increasingly use stablecoins, more precisely USDT and USDC, to safeguard their wealth. In 2024, 60% of all cryptocurrency transactions in Argentina involved stablecoins – a much higher proportion than the global average​.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Argentinians use stablecoins not just for large purchases or savings but even for buying groceries and paying utility bills. Inflation woes have similarly pushed the adoption of Bitcoin in the country, but many see it as too volatile for daily use compared with stablecoins pegged to the US dollar​. The boom in digital dollar alternatives reflects a great change in how Argentine citizens manage their finances in a hyperinflationary economy. Besides that, a peer-to-peer market has also emerged in Argentina as consumers increasingly trade digital currencies outside the formal banking system to avoid heavy taxes and currency controls​.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Venezuela</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Venezuela, where hyperinflation has driven the bolívar to rapid depreciation, cryptocurrencies have become a huge part of the economy. While the Petro experiment, the Venezuelan government's state-backed cryptocurrency, fell apart in 2024, the country's citizens have adopted Bitcoin and stablecoins en masse. This year, the usage of cryptocurrencies as remittances saw a large jump: 9% of Venezuela's $5.4 billion in annual remittances are now transferred via crypto​. In large part, remittances from nationals living abroad are a lifeline to millions of families back home. Cryptocurrency transactions provide faster, cheaper, and safer ways to send money than regular remittance services, which have high fees and can take up to several days to complete.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin also strengthens its position as a stored value in Venezuela, especially for those who want to hedge their savings against hyperinflation, which reached 400% in 2023. However, by October 2024, this figure had decreased by several times. The failure of the Petro and further reliance on decentralized alternatives are perfect examples of how distrust in government-controlled assets have led to the organic adoption of independent digital currencies. Crypto mining in Venezuela also continues to be ultra-volatile, even as government crackdowns make a mess of the country's fragmented landscape with cryptocurrencies​.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Zimbabwe</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zimbabwe's economic challenges are well known, with the country struggling to contain a hyperinflation rate of over 300% in 2024​. Over the years, Zimbabweans have used foreign currencies, particularly the US dollar, but access to such currencies has become highly constrained. This has made cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and USDT popular ways of preserving savings and doing business.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike Argentina or Venezuela, there are no strong P2P markets in Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, people in Zimbabwe have gradually become aware of the potential benefits a decentralized asset could offer them in trying to circumvent the crippling economic policy and sanctions against their country. While still lagging behind some of the other countries above, crypto remittances have become increasingly popular, as families utilize blockchains as a better way to transfer money over borders.​</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Nigeria</h3>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nigeria has grown to become one of Africa's largest cryptocurrency markets. Despite the attempts by the Nigerian government to launch a CBDC named eNaira, the citizens have been more attracted to Bitcoin and Ethereum, among others. In 2024, Nigeria ranked second in the world in crypto adoption, according to the Global Crypto Adoption Index​. Filipinos and Nigerians also use cryptocurrencies as a hedge to overcome the devaluation of their respective currencies, the peso and naira, respectively, and exorbitant transaction costs characteristic of traditional banking.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The response of the Nigerian government has meanwhile remained mixed. On the one hand, it attempts to regulate <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/best-crypto-exchanges-nigeria?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">crypto exchanges</a>, while on the other, it embarks on promoting the use of the eNaira. However, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes control very hard for governments, and Nigerians continue to prefer it as a means of value storage and for cross-border payments. Nigeria's P2P market has grown dramatically, with crypto trading volumes topping $200 million monthly in 2024​.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rise of cryptocurrencies in hyperinflated economies highlights a critical shift in how individuals respond to financial crises. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins offer immediate, practical solutions for preserving wealth and facilitating transactions when traditional currencies fail. However, while they provide valuable tools for individuals, they are not a substitute for the fundamental economic reforms needed to address hyperinflation's root causes. Sustainable recovery depends on governments implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies, and restoring confidence in national financial systems. Cryptocurrencies can support this transition but must be part of a broader strategy to achieve long-term economic stability.</p>\n\n<p>This article is only for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial or investment advice.</p>"

To start earning points, you can refer friends. Do stay tuned for the next steps of the Humanity Protocol testnet. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Humanity Protocol is a zkEVM Layer 2 blockchain that is leveraging the blockchain to create a decentralized solution for user authentication via palm recognition technology.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The protocol, which was launched by the Human Institute in collaboration with Animoca Brands and Polygon Labs, successfully raised $30 million in a Seed Round in May 2024.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Interested users can now participate in the protocol’s testnet to create a Human ID and begin earning rewards.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"What is Humanity Protocol\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21537/content_What_is_Humanity_Protocol.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 600px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital identities can be a complex matter as many users are concerned about the information and data that companies collect. The concerns range from unwanted personal data collection to this information being sold to third party entities that can then target specific content to them. To combat this growing issue, Humanity Protocol is harnessing the blockchain to create a decentralized solution that allows for personal identity ownership. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Humanity Protocol is a zkEVM <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/layer-2-l2\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2</a> blockchain leveraging Polygon CDK and fortified by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-proofs-and-zk-rollups\" target=\"_blank\">zero-knowledge</a> cryptographic proofs to ensure network security. It incorporates a combination of non-invasive biometrics and Proof-of-Humanity technology to enable users to verify their identification without disclosing personally identifiable information. The project aims to enhance user verification in the Web3 space by leveraging palm recognition technology which is less invasive than iris scans and more accessible thanks to our countless devices. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the protocol’s Proof-of-Humanity technology, third-party applications are able to authenticate users directly on their devices. Some Web3 applications are increasingly adding in requirements for identity verification as part of efforts to increase security, comply with regulations, and create a user base of trustworthy individuals. For example, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/depin-crypto-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN)</a> systems might integrate identity verification to comply with regulatory bodies in different jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Humanity Protocol is an initiative launched by Human Institute in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/animoca-brands\" target=\"_blank\">Animoca Brands</a> and Polygon Labs. Human Institute is an organization dedicated to exploring the power of science and technology including the impact of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Animoca Brands is a game software and venture capital company, and Polygon Labs is a developer of Ethereum scaling solutions. The protocol was officially founded by Terence Kwok, a tech entrepreneur who also serves as the CEO, and guided by a council of founding humans. Members of the council include Yat Siu, Co-founder and Executive Chairman of Animoca Brands, and Sandeep Nailwal, Co-founder of Polygon Labs.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On May 15, 2024, Humanity Protocol announced that it had successfully raised $30 million in a Seed Round led by Kingsway Capital. The round also received participation from Animoca Brands, Blockchain.com, Hashed, Shima Capital, and more. After concluding the funding round, Humanity Protocol’s private valuation hit $1 billion. The funds will be used to accelerate hiring and product development.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested individuals can now participate in Humanity Protocol’s testnet which will be introduced over three phases in order to progressively build the protocol’s secure identity verification system. The first phase is focusing on creating a robust network of verified individuals where users can sign up and reserve their unique Human ID. Phase 1 went live on September 30, 2024, and successfully attracted nearly 150,000 participants within the first week. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, the second phase involves palm pre-enrollment via a mobile app for users to register their biometric palm prints as well as upload and validate personal data. This phase is designed to prepare users for the final phase where they will need to undergo palm vein scanning using specialized devices. At the time of writing, no information has been provided on the devices that this phase will utilize or how users will be able to carry out this full enrollment. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Humanity Protocol continues to build and develop this decentralized identity verification platform, now is an ideal time to participate in the testnet and collect rewards. <strong>However, do note that at the time of writing, the Humanity Protocol team has not made any official announcement regarding a token airdrop. Therefore, following the steps below and participating in Humanity Protocol’s testnet does not guarantee a future token airdrop allocation.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Reserve Your Human ID</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Head over to <a href=\"https://testnet.humanity.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://testnet.humanity.org/</a> to enroll in the testnet. Depending on the number of users attempting to sign up at the same time, you might be put into a line requiring a short wait. We only had to wait about a minute or two before being able to sign up.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Enroll in Humanity Protocol Testnet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21509/content_1._Line.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 655px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, you will need to either connect your wallet, sign up via email address, or connect one of your social accounts. In this example, we will be <strong>Connecting our Wallet</strong>.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Sign up options for Humanity Protocol\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21510/content_1.1_Options.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 655px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will be using MetaMask to proceed.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Sign up for Humanity Protocol with MetaMask\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21511/content_1.2_Wallet.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 520px;\"></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Humanity testnet network will be added to your wallet and you need to <strong>Sign the Message</strong> to verify your account.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Sign message from Humanity Protocol to prove account ownership\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21512/content_1.3_Sign_message.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 720px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next, create your Human ID by choosing a name and entering a referral Human ID. If you don’t have any friends with referral codes, you can input the letter “t” which has been set by Humanity Protocol as a widely accepted code.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Create Human ID on Humanity Protocol\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21513/content_2._Create_ID.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 685px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, complete your profile by providing your first name, last name, and email address. You will receive an email with a link to confirm your email address.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do take note that due to the testnet nature of Humanity Protocol, this step does require patience as the above actions might need to be repeated in order to receive the verification email.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Complete Humanity Protocol profile\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21514/content_2.1_Complete_profile.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 685px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Refer Others</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once your Human ID has been created, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Refer others to Humanity Protocol\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21515/content_2.2_welcome.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 685px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the top, you will see your Human ID, wallet address, rewards balance, and ranking in the leaderboard. Our Human ID and wallet address have been blurred out for privacy purposes in the image below.</p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Humanity Protocol Account Summary\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21516/content_2.3_Dashboard.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 685px;\"></div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under your rewards information, you can find <strong>Your referral link</strong> to share with friends and other users in order to collect your referral rewards. There is also a Genesis Reward which can be claimed every 20 hours. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Bridge</strong> and <strong>Faucet</strong> are currently for developers to test their code and will not provide you with any rewards. On top of that, the <strong>Palm Not Enrolled</strong> is a feature that will be released in Phase 2, therefore no action is required at this time. </p>\n\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Humanity Protocol Dashboard\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21517/content_2.4_Referrals.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 664px;\"></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Humanity Protocol is a zkEVM protocol built on Polygon CDK that was launched by Humanity Institute in collaboration with Animoca Brands and Polygon Labs. It aims to introduce a new method of user identity verification through digital palm recognition in order to create a decentralized solution that allows for personal identity ownership. Interested individuals can now participate in the Humanity Protocol testnet to register their Human ID and earn rewards by referring others.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do note that airdrop farming is highly speculative and following the above steps are no guarantee that you will receive a share. Moreover, always verify that your are connecting your wallet to the official protocol to avoid falling victim to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/airdrop-scams-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">airdrop scams</a>. Always do your own research before interacting with any protocols. </p>"
